## ⚠️ Gaps to Address in Interview

### 1. PhD vs MSc
**Your Answer**:
> "While I hold an MSc rather than a PhD, my 10 years of hands-on experience delivering enterprise-scale AI and analytics has equipped me with practical expertise that translates immediately to business value. I've led teams, deployed production systems, and delivered $150K in savings—outcomes that matter more than academic credentials. That said, I'm committed to continuous learning and stay current with the latest AI/ML research."

### 2. AI/ML vs Data Engineering
**Your Answer**:
> "My data engineering background is actually a strength for this role. I've learned that successful AI/ML at enterprise scale requires 80% solid infrastructure and 20% models. I've built the pipelines that enable ML—feature stores, real-time inference, model monitoring—and I understand the operational challenges of deploying AI in production. I'm technical enough to lead AI/ML teams while ensuring they build on robust infrastructure."

### 3. 5+ Years Leadership
**Your Answer**:
> "While I have 2-3 years in formal leadership roles, I've led at significant scale—50+ multidisciplinary professionals, which is larger than most leaders with 5+ years experience manage. I've proven I can build teams, drive adoption, and deliver measurable business impact. What matters is scope and outcomes, not just years."
