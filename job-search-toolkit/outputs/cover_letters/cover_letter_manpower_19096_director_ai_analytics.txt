RE: Director of Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Data Analytics (Ref: 19096)

Dear Khuong,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Director of AI & Data Analytics role with your client. With over 10 years of experience leading enterprise-scale data and analytics initiatives that deliver measurable business impact—including 80% operational automation saving $150K annually, 30% faster delivery timelines, and processing 500M+ healthcare records with 99.9% reliability—I am excited about the opportunity to drive AI transformation across a diversified conglomerate portfolio.

At Jio Health, I led a cross-functional team of 50+ professionals to architect and deploy ML-powered analytics infrastructure supporting 3x user growth while improving data quality by 50%. My approach centers on translating complex business challenges into high-value data solutions: I've built real-time data pipelines, deployed predictive analytics at scale, and enabled personalized insights for millions of users. This experience directly translates to your organization's needs across retail personalization, demand forecasting for consumer goods, risk management for financial services, and operational efficiency for telecom—all requiring the same foundation of scalable AI/ML infrastructure I've built.

My healthcare domain expertise is particularly transferable to your conglomerate's portfolio: regulatory compliance (pharmacy/financial services), consumer personalization (retail/F&B), and operational optimization (telecom) share the same data maturity challenges I've successfully addressed. Additionally, being based in Ho Chi Minh City, I operate professionally in English and have basic Vietnamese—enough for everyday interactions—so I can quickly engage with stakeholders and drive adoption across your organization.

While I hold an MSc rather than a PhD, my decade of hands-on leadership delivering AI and analytics at enterprise scale has equipped me with the practical expertise to drive immediate business value. My track record of 80% automation, $150K cost savings, 99.9% system reliability, and 100% HIPAA compliance demonstrates my ability to balance innovation with operational excellence—critical for a conglomerate spanning multiple regulated industries.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my proven experience in building high-performing teams, architecting scalable AI/ML platforms, and delivering quantified business outcomes aligns with your client's vision for AI-driven digital transformation.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to speaking with you.

Best regards,

Simon Renauld
