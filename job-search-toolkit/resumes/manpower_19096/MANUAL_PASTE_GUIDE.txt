PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Director-level AI and analytics leader with over a decade building enterprise data platforms and ML infrastructure that deliver measurable business value. I've spent my career turning complex data challenges into practical solutions—from processing half a billion healthcare records with near-perfect reliability to automating operations that saved $150K annually.

What drives me is leading talented teams to solve real problems. At Jio Health, I managed a diverse group of 50+ data scientists, engineers, and analysts, helping them do their best work while delivering results the business could see and feel. I'm particularly drawn to companies undergoing digital transformation, where data and AI become strategic differentiators.

Based in Ho Chi Minh City, I operate professionally in English and have basic Vietnamese. I understand the technical nuances and business context needed to succeed in Vietnam's evolving market.

WHAT I BRING TO YOUR ORGANIZATION

I'm not just another data leader who talks strategy without rolling up my sleeves. I've built teams, written code, debugged production issues at 2 AM, and sat in boardrooms explaining why investing in data infrastructure matters. I understand the full spectrum—from the technical details of distributed systems to the business language that gets executives to say yes.

What excites me about this role is the opportunity to work across multiple industries—retail, financial services, pharma, telecom. My healthcare background gives me a deep appreciation for data quality, privacy, and building systems people trust. These principles transfer directly to any industry where data drives decisions.

I'm ready to build something meaningful with your team.
