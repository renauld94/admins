## WHAT I BRING TO YOUR ORGANIZATION

I'm not just another data leader who talks strategy without rolling up my sleeves. I've built teams, written code, debugged production issues at 2 AM, and sat in boardrooms explaining why investing in data infrastructure matters. I understand the full spectrum—from the technical details of distributed systems to the business language that gets executives to say yes.

What excites me about this role is the opportunity to work across multiple industries—retail, financial services, pharma, telecom. My healthcare background gives me a deep appreciation for data quality, privacy, and building systems people trust. These principles transfer directly to any industry where data drives decisions.

I'm ready to build something meaningful with your team.
