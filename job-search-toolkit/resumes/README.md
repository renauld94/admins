## Tips for Creating New Versions

1. **Start with full resume**: Copy base version
2. **Analyze job description**: Extract keywords, requirements, nice-to-haves
3. **Reframe experience**: Use job's language while staying truthful
4. **Quantify everything**: Numbers speak louder than adjectives
5. **Human voice**: Write like you're talking to a person, not a robot
6. **Proofread**: Get a friend to read it—they'll catch what you miss
