Dear Khuong Le,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Director of Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Data Analytics position (Ref 19096) for your client. With over 10 years of experience building enterprise-scale AI and analytics platforms, I am confident I can deliver the measurable business outcomes your client is seeking.

Key highlights of my experience:

• Led AI & analytics teams of 50+ professionals (data scientists, ML engineers, and analysts) across healthcare operations
• Delivered 80% operational automation saving $150K annually through ML-powered workflows
• Architected platforms processing 500M+ records monthly with 99.9% reliability and 100% regulatory compliance
• Drove 30% faster project delivery and 40% infrastructure cost reduction through strategic technology leadership
• Based in Ho Chi Minh City; professional English; basic Vietnamese—ready to work effectively across all levels of your client's organization

While my recent experience is in healthcare, the principles I've mastered—data quality, governance, scalability, and compliance—transfer directly to retail, financial services, pharma, and telecom. I'm particularly drawn to organizations undergoing digital transformation, where data and AI become strategic differentiators.

I have attached my resume and cover letter for your review. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my track record of delivering measurable AI and analytics outcomes aligns with your client's digital transformation objectives.

I am available for an interview at your convenience and can be reached at +84 964 294 885 or sn.renauld@gmail.com.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,

Simon Renauld
