## 💰 SALARY NEGOTIATION STRATEGY

### BEFORE THE CALL
- [ ] Research market salary for role/company/location
- [ ] Calculate total compensation package
- [ ] Prepare 3 alternative proposals
- [ ] Know your walk-away number
- [ ] Have competing offers ready (if possible)

### DURING NEGOTIATION
```
"Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about the role.
I was expecting [$X] based on [research/experience/offer].
Can we discuss adjusting the offer to $_______?"
```

### KEY NEGOTIATION POINTS (Priority Order)

1. **Base Salary** (Most important)
   - Usually non-negotiable after initial offer
   - BUT: Try to increase before accepting
   - Typical increase: 5-15%

2. **Equity/Stock**
   - Often more flexible than salary
   - Long-term value (4 year vesting)
   - Ask: "Can you increase equity to ___% to better align?"

3. **Sign-On Bonus**
   - Easier to negotiate than salary
   - Ask: "What's the sign-on bonus range?"
   - Typical: 10-30% of base

4. **Timing Flexibility**
   - Start date
   - Notice period assistance
   - Vacation timing

5. **Flexibility**
   - Remote work options
   - WFH days/weeks
   - Flexible schedule

### NEGOTIATION SCRIPT TEMPLATE

```
Recruiter: "We can offer $200K"

You: "Thank you! That's competitive. Given my 15+ years of 
experience in data engineering and leadership, plus my 
[specific achievement], I was hoping for closer to $220K. 
Can we discuss that?"

[They might counter with $210K]

You: "I appreciate that. Could we split the difference at 
$215K, and also increase the equity to ___% to better align 
long-term interests?"

[If still no on salary]

You: "I'd be happy to accept $200K if we could add a $30K 
sign-on bonus and increase equity to ___%, plus the ability 
to work remote 3 days/week."
```

### RED FLAGS - When NOT to Negotiate Too Hard
- They explicitly say: "This is our final offer, take it or leave it"
- Company is clearly in financial distress
- They're rescinding offers
- You have multiple strong offers (be patient)
