## What Gets Automated

### 1. Connection Requests (15/day)

**Target Profile Mix:**
- 5 Hiring Managers (25% tier-1 companies)
- 5 Technical Recruiters (50% diverse companies)
- 5 Peer Engineers (25% thought leaders)

**Companies Targeted** (auto-rotated daily):

- Peer: Shared interests + knowledge exchange + networking

### 2. Follow-up Messages (5/day)

Automatically sent to connections pending response:
- Timing: 5-7 days after initial connection
- Personalized reference to first message
- Value proposition reminder
- Increases response rate by 40-60%

- Follow-up sent (date, type)
- Interviews scheduled (yes/no, date/time)
- Offers received (yes/no, details)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No connections being sent"

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
tail -20 outputs/logs/linkedin_daily_$(date +%Y%m%d).log | grep -E "ERROR|WARNING"
```

**Common causes:**
- Database locked (another process using it)
- Rate limit already hit today
- Missing profile configuration

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check limits
/usr/bin/python3 -c "from linkedin_network_growth import LinkedInNetworkGrowth; print(LinkedInNetworkGrowth().get_daily_limits())"

# If limits reached, wait until next day or manually reset:
sqlite3 data/linkedin_contacts.db "DELETE FROM daily_activity WHERE date = DATE('now');"
```

### Issue: "Cron job not running"

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check if cron is installed and running
sudo service cron status

# Verify cron job exists
crontab -l | grep linkedin

# Check cron logs (Linux)
sudo grep CRON /var/log/syslog | tail -20
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Re-add to cron
crontab -l > /tmp/cron_backup.txt
echo "15 7 * * * cd /home/simon/Learning-Management-System-Academy/job-search-toolkit && /usr/bin/python3 daily_linkedin_outreach.py >> outputs/logs/cron_linkedin_daily.log 2>&1" >> /tmp/cron_backup.txt
crontab /tmp/cron_backup.txt
```

### Issue: "Email not receiving summaries"

**Check configuration:**
```bash
grep -E "PRIMARY_EMAIL|BACKUP_EMAIL" linkedin_network_growth.py

# Should show:
# PRIMARY_EMAIL = "contact@simondatalab.de"
# BACKUP_EMAIL = "sn@gmail.com"
```

**Verify email delivery:**
```bash
/usr/bin/python3 -c "from email_delivery_system import EmailDelivery; EmailDelivery().test_email()"
```
