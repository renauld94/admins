Part one =E2=80=94 A Simple Explanation of Modern Data Warehousing
Our goals and our context
We are here to build a system that gets all company data, tidily, in one pl=
ace. That allows us to make dashboards that executives and managers look at=
, charts and tools that analysts and product managers can use to do deep di=
ves, alerts on anomalies, and a breadth of linked data that allows data sci=
entists and researchers to look for magic or product insights. The basic bu=
ilding blocks are tables, and the pipelines that create and maintain them.
Sidebar: DB vs Data lake? OLTP vs OLAP? Production vs warehouse? Here=E2=80=
=99s what you need to know.
A basic point about a data warehouse (or lake, or pond, or whatever trendy =
buzzword people use today) is that it is not production. It must be a separ=
ate system from =E2=80=9Cthe databases we use to power the product=E2=80=9D=
=2E
Both are =E2=80=9Cdatabases=E2=80=9D, both have =E2=80=9Cdata=E2=80=9D, inc=
luding =E2=80=9Ctables=E2=80=9D that might be similar or mirrored =E2=80=93=
 but the similarity should end there.
Your production database is meant to be fast, serve your product and users.=
 It is optimized for code to read and write.
Your warehouse is meant to be human-usable, and serve people inside the bus=
iness. It is optimized for breadth, for use by human analysts, and to have =
historical records.
Put it this way =E2=80=93 your ecommerce webapp needs to look up an item=E2=
=80=99s price and return it as fast as possible. Your warehouse needs to lo=
ok up an item from a year ago, and look at how the price changed over the c=
ourse of months. The database powering the webapp won=E2=80=99t even store =
the information, much less make it easy to compute. Meanwhile if you run a =
particularly difficult query, you don=E2=80=99t want your webapp to slow do=
wn.
So =E2=80=93 split them. (You might hear people talking about OLTP vs OLAP =
=E2=80=93 it=E2=80=99s just this distinction. Ignore the confusing terminol=
ogy. Here=E2=80=99s a deep dive into the two types of OLAP data model (Kimb=
all and One Big Table)  [ https://substack.com/redirect/ff02779f-053a-4d6e-=
ab17-c74067856805?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn0.Xt_QeDUo-XU_b4nzbR7ItMXV1fLOwIjU_=
0GR6EVSHuA ])
So, we want a warehouse. Ideally, it should:
Be separate from our production databases
Collect all data that is useful to the company
Have tables that make queries easy
Be correct =E2=80=93 with accurate, trusted, information
Be reasonably up to date =E2=80=93 with perhaps a daily lag, rather than a =
weekly or monthly one
Power charts and interactive tools, while also being useful for automatic a=
nd local queries
This used to be difficult! (It is not anymore!) There was a tradeoff betwee=
n =E2=80=9Cbig enough to have all the data we need=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cgi=
ve answers fast enough to be useful=E2=80=9D. A lot of hard work was put in=
to reconciling those two needs.
Since circa 2015 or so, this pretty much no longer a problem. Presto/Trino,=
 Spark, and hosted databases (BigQuery, Snowflake, the AWS offerings) and o=
ther tools allow you to have arbitrarily huge data, accessed quickly. We li=
ve in a golden age.
Sidebar: At my old school=E2=80=A6
At Meta, they used HDFS and Hive to power their data lake and MySQL to powe=
r production. Once a day they took a =E2=80=9Csnapshot=E2=80=9D of producti=
on with a corresponding date stamp and moved the data from MySQL to Hive.
In a world where storage is cheap, access to data can be measured in second=
s rather than minutes or hours, and data is overflowing, the bottleneck is =
engineering time and conceptual complexity. Solving that bottleneck allows =
us to break with annoyingly fiddly past best practices. That=E2=80=99s what=
 I=E2=80=99m here to talk about.
A basic setup
Imagine your warehouse as a giant box, holding many, many tables. Think of =
data flowing downhill through it.
At the top: raw copies from production databases, marketing APIs, payment p=
rocessors, whatever.
At the bottom: clean, trusted tables that analysts actually query.
In between: pipelines that flow data from table to table.
[Raw Input Tables]
=E2=94=9C=E2=94=80 users_production
=E2=94=9C=E2=94=80 events_raw
=E2=94=9C=E2=94=80 transactions_raw [Pipelines]
=E2=94=94=E2=94=80 ... =E2=86=93

     Clean =E2=86=92 Join =E2=86=92 Enrich

                 =E2=86=93

[Clean Output Tables]
=E2=94=9C=E2=94=80 dim_users
=E2=94=9C=E2=94=80 fct_events
=E2=94=94=E2=94=80 grp_daily_revenue
How do we get from raw input to clean tables? Pipelines. (See buzzwords lik=
e ETL, ELT? Ignore the froth =E2=80=93 replace with =E2=80=9Cpipelines=E2=
=80=9D and move on).
Pipelines are the #1 tool of data engineering. At their most basic form, th=
ey=E2=80=99re pieces of code that take in one or more input tables, do some=
thing to the data, and output a different table.
What language do you write pipelines in? Like it or not, the lingua franca =
of editing large-scale data is SQL. The lingua franca of accessing large sc=
ale data is SQL. SQL is a constrained enough language that it can paralleli=
ze easily. The tools that invisibly translate your simple snippets into com=
plex mechanisms to grab data from different machines, transform it, join it=
, etc =E2=80=93 they not only are literally set up with SQL in mind, they f=
iguratively cannot do the same for python, java, etc. Why? Because a tradit=
ional programming language gives you too much flexibility -- there=E2=80=99=
s no guarantee that your imperative code can be parallelized nicely.
Sidebar: When non-SQL makes sense (or doesn=E2=80=99t)
If you=E2=80=99re ingesting data from the outside world (calling APIs, read=
ing streams, and so on), then python, javascript, etc could make sense. But=
 once data is in the warehouse, beware anything that isn=E2=80=99t SQL =E2=
=80=93 it=E2=80=99s likely unnecessary, and almost certainly going to be mu=
ch slower than everything else.
Your tooling might offer a way to =E2=80=9Cbackdoor=E2=80=9D a bit of code =
(e.g. =E2=80=9Cwrite some java code that calls an API and then writes the r=
esultant variable to a column=E2=80=9D). Think twice before you use it. Oft=
en, it=E2=80=99s easier and faster to import a new dataset into your wareho=
use so that you can recreate with SQL joins what you would have done using =
an imperative language.
You may be tempted to transform or analyze data in R, pandas, or whatnot =
=E2=80=93 that=E2=80=99s fine, but you do that by interactively reading fro=
m the warehouse. Rule of thumb: if you=E2=80=99re writing between tables in=
 a warehouse =E2=80=93 SQL. Into a warehouse =E2=80=93 you probably need so=
me glue code somewhere. Out of a warehouse =E2=80=93 that=E2=80=99s on you.
So here=E2=80=99s the simple setup:
Then, set up a system of pipelines to this, every day, as soon as the upstr=
eam data is ready:
As each of these input tables gets the latest dump of data from outside: ta=
ke that latest day=E2=80=99s data, deduplicate, clean it up a bit, rename t=
he columns, and cascade it to a nicer, cleaner version of that table. (this=
 is your silver tier data in medallion architecture [ https://substack.com/=
redirect/827a34b9-567c-44f6-bc04-665ef5a37beb?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn0.Xt_Qe=
DUo-XU_b4nzbR7ItMXV1fLOwIjU_0GR6EVSHuA ])
Then, from that nicer input table, perform a host of transformations, joins=
, etc to write to other downstream tables. (this is your master data)
Master data is highly trusted which makes building metrics and powering das=
hboards easy!
Every day, new data comes in, and your pipeline setup cascades new informat=
ion in a host of tables downstream of it. That=E2=80=99s the setup.
A well-ordered table structure
Okay, so to review: the basic useful item in a warehouse is a table. Tables=
 are created (and filled up by) pipelines.
=E2=80=9CGreat, great,=E2=80=9D you might say =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9Cbut which =
tables do I build?=E2=80=9D
For the sake of example, let=E2=80=99s imagine our product is a social netw=
ork. But this typology should work just as well for whichever business you =
are in =E2=80=93 from b2b saas to ecommerce to astrophysics.
>From the perspective of the data warehouse as a product, there are only thr=
ee kinds of tables: input tables (copied from outside), staging tables (use=
d by pipelines and machines), and output tables =E2=80=93 also known as use=
r-facing tables.
Output tables (in fact, almost all tables) really only have three types:
Tables where each row corresponds to a noun. (E.g. =E2=80=9Cuser=E2=80=9D, =
or even =E2=80=9Cpost=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Ccomment=E2=80=9D). When done rig=
ht, these are called dimension tables. Prefix their names with dim_
Tables where each row corresponds to an action. Think of them as fancier ve=
rsions of logs. (E.g. =E2=80=9Cuser X wrote post Y at time Z=E2=80=9D). Whe=
n done right, these are called fact tables. Prefix their names with fct_
Everything else. Often these will be summary tables. (e.g. =E2=80=9Cnumber =
of users who made at least 1 post, per country, per day). If you=E2=80=99re=
 proud of these, prefix them with sum_ or agg_.
Sidebar: more on naming
YMMV, but I generally don=E2=80=99t prefix input tables. Input tables shoul=
d be an exact copy of the table you=E2=80=99re importing from outside the w=
arehouse. Changing names breaks that =E2=80=93 and an unprefixed table name=
 is a good sign that the table cannot be trusted.
Staging and temporary tables are prefixed with stg_ or tmp_.
Let=E2=80=99s talk more about dimension and fact tables, since they=E2=80=
=99re the core part of any clean warehouse.
Dimension tables are the clean, user-friendly, mature form of noun tables.
Despite being focused on nouns (say, users), they can also roll up useful v=
erby information (leveraging cumulative table design [ https://substack.com=
/redirect/d7dd1cdc-e878-4a71-8cbf-aa01b1c43e7e?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn0.Xt_Q=
eDUo-XU_b4nzbR7ItMXV1fLOwIjU_0GR6EVSHuA ])
For instance, a dim_users table might both include stuff like: user id, dat=
e created, datetime last seen, number of friends, name; AND more aggregate =
=E2=80=9Cverby=E2=80=9D information like: total number of posts written, co=
mments made in the last 7 days, number of days active in the last month, nu=
mber of views yesterday.
If a data analyst might consistently want that data =E2=80=93 maybe add it =
to the table! Your small code tweak will save them hours of waiting a week.
(Now, what=E2=80=99s to stop the table from being unusably wide? Say, with =
500+ columns? Well, that=E2=80=99s mostly an internal culture problem, and =
somewhat a tooling problem. You could imagine, say, dim_user getting too la=
rge, so the more extraneous information is in a dim_user_extras table, to b=
e joined in when necessary. Or using complex data types to reduce the numbe=
r of columns)
Fact tables are the clean, user-friendly, mature form of logs (or actions o=
r verb tables).
Despite being verb focused, fact tables contains noun information. (Zach ch=
imes in: here=E2=80=99s a free 4 hour course [ https://substack.com/redirec=
t/6727138d-bee1-4043-aa6e-41bb1e672cb2?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn0.Xt_QeDUo-XU_=
b4nzbR7ItMXV1fLOwIjU_0GR6EVSHuA ] on everything you need to know about fact=
 tables)
Unlike a plain log, which will be terse, they can also be enriched with dat=
a that might probably live in a dim table.
The essence of a good fact table is providing all the necessary context to =
do analysis of the event in question.
A fact table, fundamentally, helps you understand: =E2=80=9CThing X happene=
d at time Y. And here=E2=80=99s a bunch of context Z that you might enjoy=
=E2=80=9D.
So a log containing =E2=80=9CUser Z made comment Xa on post Xb at time Y=E2=
=80=9D could turn into a fct_comment table, with fields like: commenter id,=
 comment id, post id, time, time at commenter timezone, comment text, post =
text, userid of owner of post, time zone of owner of parent post. Some of t=
hese fields are strictly speaking unnecessary =E2=80=93 you could in theory=
 do some joins to grab the post text, or the comment text, or time zone of =
the owner of the parent post. But they=E2=80=99re useful to have handy for =
your users, so why not save them time and grab them anyway.
Q: Wait =E2=80=93 so if dim tables also have verb data, and fact tables als=
o have noun data, what=E2=80=99s the difference?
A: Glad you asked. Here=E2=80=99s what it boils down to =E2=80=93 is there =
one row per noun in the table? Dim. One row per =E2=80=9Ca thing happened?=
=E2=80=9D Fact. That=E2=80=99s it. You=E2=80=99re welcome.
Here, as in so much, we are spending space freely. We are duplicating data.=
 We are also doing a macro form of caching =E2=80=93 rather than forcing us=
ers to join or group data on the fly, we have pipelines do it ahead of time=
=2E
Compute is cheap, storage is cheap. Staff time is not. We want analysis to =
be fluid and low latency =E2=80=93 both technically in terms of compute, an=
d in terms of mental overhead.
Q: Wait! What about data stamps? Where=E2=80=99s the magic? You promised ma=
gic.
A: Patience, young grasshopper. Part of enlightenment is the journey. Part =
of understanding the magic is understanding what it builds on. And =E2=80=
=93 hey =E2=80=93 would YOU read a huge blog post all at once? Or would you=
 prefer to read it in chunks. Yeah, you with your Tiktok problem and inabil=
ity to focus. I=E2=80=99m surprised you even made this far.
