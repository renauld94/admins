--------------------

----------## How to motivate others/uplift your team

In an ideal world, you=E2=80=99d turn up to work with a team of self-motiva=
ted people who are happy to be there, chomping at the bit to get started.

But in reality, that=E2=80=99s not the case.

In almost every organization, there's usually a few people who drag their h=
eels. And even the most motivated team members can have off days or weeks.

So what do you do about it?

Well, here=E2=80=99s how I think about it:

There are two main approaches to motivation:

1. **Fear-based motivation**, where your team does stuff well because they'=
re scared of making mistakes or facing consequences.

2. **Enthusiasm-based motivation**, where they work hard because they genui=
nely want to.

When I first started managing people, I thought pure enthusiasm was the key=
. Get everyone excited about the work, and they'll naturally give their all=
, right?

Wrong.

I quickly learned that's not always enough. The truth is, effective motivat=
ion is about finding the right mix of enthusiasm and accountability for eac=
h individual on your team.

Some people thrive on enthusiasm, sure. But others need clear expectations =
and accountability. Most fall somewhere in between.

So how do you strike this balance? Here are some ideas:

----------
**=E2=80=A6by the way, if you use LinkedIn, **_**[go to my profile](https:/=
/www.linkedin.com/in/rohanmahtani/)**_** and hit the =E2=80=98Follow=E2=80=
=99 button**. I share a mix of practical career strategy and mid-week motiv=
ation =E2=80=94=C2=A0stuff that makes it easy to keep your career on track.=
=20

_**Topics coming up**_: how to get promoted faster than others, how to buil=
d instant rapport with people (even senior leaders) and how to sound more c=
onfident (even if you=E2=80=99re an introvert). _[See you there](https://ww=
w.linkedin.com/comm/mynetwork/discovery-see-all?usecase=3DPEOPLE_FOLLOWS&fo=
llowMember=3Drohanmahtani)_.

alright, let=E2=80=99s get back to my essay=E2=80=A6


----------### =F0=9F=A7=A9** Understand individual motivations**

One of the best questions I've heard a manager ask new team members is, "_H=
ow would you like to be noticed_?"

This question reveals a lot about what drives each person. Some might say t=
hey want public recognition in team meetings. Others might prefer a private=
 word of thanks. Some might value new responsibilities more than praise. So=
me might value the income purely and treat this as a job that pays the bill=
s.

Understanding these differences helps me tailor my approach and makes sure =
each person gets the kind of recognition they actually want. That=E2=80=99s=
 when people are most motivated.

### =F0=9F=94=91**  Encourage ownership**

Let your team work the way they want to work. The more free rein you give p=
eople, the more motivated you'll find them.

As George Patton said, "Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what =
to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity."

**Good**: A manager assigns a project to a team member, clearly outlines th=
e goals and deadlines, then steps back. They check in periodically but trus=
t the employee to handle the details.

**Bad**: A manager assigns a task, then constantly asks for updates, sugges=
ts changes to the approach, and questions every decision.

### =F0=9F=8E=AF**  Set clear expectations**

Obviously, you=E2=80=99ve got to be very clear about the end goal to pass o=
ver the reins. Make sure everyone understands:

* What do you want done?=20

* By when?=20

* How often do you want updates?=20

* And what are the stakes if it goes wrong? What happens if things go right=
? (e.g. =E2=80=9Cif we hit our target, we=E2=80=99ll be doubling our market=
ing budget on this stream; if we don=E2=80=99t, we=E2=80=99ll have to cut s=
pend here=E2=80=9D)

If your team understands the stakes, they=E2=80=99ll feel more accountable =
and be more motivated.

### =F0=9F=91=8F **Sprinkle your praise (don't pour it)**

Complimenting your team's good work is critical for morale. Everyone apprec=
iates knowing they're on the right track

I used to think more praise was always better. But I noticed something odd =
- when I praised everything, it started to mean nothing.

IMO, a better approach is to =E2=80=98sprinkle=E2=80=99 your praise =E2=80=
=93 say it when you actually mean it. That way, your team members appreciat=
e it more.

For example, instead of a generic "good job" for every task, try pointing o=
ut specific things: "I liked how you handled that client's complaint. Your =
patience turned a potentially negative situation into a positive one."

### =F0=9F=91=82 **Emphasize the =E2=80=9Cwhy=E2=80=9D**

Human beings want to know their jobs (and lives) matter. And when you think=
 about it, most jobs do matter. It=E2=80=99s just that we as leaders often =
fail to tell people that. So most people (including managers themselves!) f=
eel they=E2=80=99re just a cog in a machine.

Ask yourself: do your team members know how their job fits into the big pic=
ture? Do you? If not, how can you find out and explain it to them?

For example: When our tech team was working on a seemingly mundane database=
 update, I explained how it would help our customer service team respond fa=
ster. Suddenly, a boring task became crucial to improving the experience of=
 our users and making them feel happier using our resume tools.

Similarly, don't just ask for a report. Explain how that report will influe=
nce important decisions: "This market analysis you're working on will help =
us decide which products to develop next year. It could shape our entire st=
rategy."

Context often turns mundane tasks into meaningful contributions, boosting e=
veryone=E2=80=99s motivation, including your own.

### =F0=9F=A7=82 **The John Wooden touch**

John Wooden, the =E2=80=9Cwinningest=E2=80=9D coach in basketball history s=
aid this to his players at the start of the season.=20

(paraphrasing) =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m gonna treat you all differently, becaus=
e you=E2=80=99re all different.=E2=80=9D

He=E2=80=99d shout at some players a little more, and he=E2=80=99d be a lit=
tle softer on others. _He gave each player what they needed._

Remember, what works for one person might not work for another. Some team m=
embers are motivated by direct, even blunt feedback. Others need a gentler =
touch. The key to motivating others is to respect their individuality, and =
recognize a one-size-fits-all approach never works.

1. **Tell a friend about these emails**. **[Here=E2=80=99s a link](https://=

## How to write an executive or senior-level resume

_Read the full article __[here](https://resumeworded.com/blog/executive-res=
ume/)__._

If you're a senior job seeker =E2=80=94 or an executive =E2=80=94 you'll fi=
nd this especially useful. Even if you aren't, skim through it anyway since=
 a couple of these learnings apply to resumes at all stages.

Hiring managers expect different things from senior-level candidates than t=
hey do from mid- or junior-level applicants. Here are three examples:

**=F0=9F=97=A3=EF=B8=8F =C2=A0Highlight leadership and management experienc=
e. **Tell hiring managers about the teams you led or how many direct report=
s you have. "Directed team of 5 to ..." can be a good phrase to use.

=F0=9F=A7=90** =C2=A0Leave off your graduation dates **if they're 12+ years=
 old to avoid age discrimination. Plus, leave off outdated software or skil=
ls (e.g. Windows XP).

=F0=9F=93=88** =C2=A0Emphasize promotions, particularly in your job titles.=
 **Bold titles that show obvious progression, like Vice President -> Direct=
or -> Managing Director.=20

=F0=9F=8E=AF =C2=A0You should also use a tool like [Score My Resume](https:=
//resumeworded.com/score) to find out if your resume is effective enough =
=E2=80=94 at any career level =E2=80=94 including senior, mid and entry-lev=
el. It'll tell you if you've overlooked any mistakes that hiring managers l=
ook out for. [Try it now](http://resumeworded.com/free-resume-review).

----------## If you=E2=80=99re new here, hi!

Hey, I'm Rohan. Some people are into yoga, others are into fishing - me, I'=
m all about self-improvement. Years ago, I got fed up with the fluff that p=
asses for career advice out there. So, I started Resume Worded and this ema=
il series, Coached, to share the industry insider info I was learning.

Think of this email as your weekly dose of career coaching you didn't know =
you needed. No fluff, no platitudes, no-BS =E2=80=94 just real stuff that y=
ou need to hear to shape your career into what you want it to be.

Until next time,
