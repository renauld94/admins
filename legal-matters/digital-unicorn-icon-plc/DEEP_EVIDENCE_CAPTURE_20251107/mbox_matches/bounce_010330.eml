----------## How to build rapport

One of my favourite pieces of career advice is from the 2012 commencement s=
peech Neil Gaiman gave to UAL.

=E2=80=9CTo get hired, and __stay__ hired,=E2=80=9D he said, you need to do=
 three things:

1. Be easy to get along with

2. Do good work

3. Deliver your work on time

Then he adds,=C2=A0

=E2=80=9CAnd you don=E2=80=99t even need all three. _Two out of three is fi=
ne_!

People will tolerate how unpleasant you are if your work is good and you de=
liver it on time. People will forgive the lateness of your work if it=E2=80=
=99s good and they like you. And you don=E2=80=99t have to be as good as ev=
eryone else if you=E2=80=99re on time and it=E2=80=99s always a pleasure to=
 hear from you.=E2=80=9D

I always smile when I hear that, although I do admit, having all three is p=
robably best.

So, assuming our work is good and delivered on time, **how can we be easy t=
o get along with, & build rapport**?

Here are some things I've learned of how to do this at work.

### =F0=9F=91=8F**  Give **_**genuine**_**, extremely **__**specific**__** =
compliments. **

Most people you meet are starved for appreciation and crave recognition. So=
 when the opportunity presents itself, give them some!

_Where people go wrong is giving insincere, canned compliments which people=
 can see a mile away_. Don=E2=80=99t do this as a cheap trick, but embrace =
it as a principle.

* =E2=9D=8C=C2=A0 Bad: =E2=80=9CNice presentation the other day=E2=80=9D

* =E2=9C=85=C2=A0 Good: "Great opening story in yesterday=E2=80=99s present=
ation. Where did you learn that?"

----------
**=E2=80=A6by the way, if you use LinkedIn, **_**[go to my profile](https:/=
/www.linkedin.com/in/rohanmahtani/)**_** and hit the =E2=80=98Follow=E2=80=
=99 button**. I share a mix of practical career strategy and mid-week motiv=
ation =E2=80=94=C2=A0stuff that makes it easy to keep your career on track.

Topics coming up this week: how to build a world-class network quickly (wit=
hout being sleazy), a framework I use everyday to get unstuck, and more. [S=
ee you there.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohanmahtani/)

alright, let=E2=80=99s get back to my essay=E2=80=A6


----------### =E3=83=84**  Smile**

Have you ever worked with someone who=E2=80=99s so negative they suck all t=
he energy out of the room? They spend their whole lives scowling, without a=
 good word to say about anything.

_Don=E2=80=99t be that person._

Instead, give energy to your environment by smiling. You don=E2=80=99t need=
 to be Pollyanna, but be more positive than negative. No-one likes a killjo=
y. Aim to make everyone=E2=80=99s day better for having spoken with you.

### =F0=9F=AA=9E** Mirror, mirror**

Mirroring is a technique often used in negotiations where you subtly reflec=
t the other person's body language and tone. It's a way to build rapport an=
d create a sense of familiarity without saying a word.

It sounds weird, but mirroring really does work. I was skeptical at first, =
but then I started noticing how often it happens in natural conversations.

Think about the last time you were really engaged in a discussion with a fr=
iend. Chances are, you started to mirror each other's body language without=
 even realizing it. Leaning in at the same time, matching each other's tone=
 and pace, using similar mannerisms.

DGd68-1Ce0M3-ONw7hg0_Mdy-42okgSSn6UYodwgb8wnj6LHwXU)

Mirroring is a powerful tool in the business world too. When you=E2=80=99re=
 in a meeting and want to build rapport with someone, subtly reflect their =
body language:

* If their posture is closed, do the same

* If they're more laid back and relaxed, mirror that

* If they gesture a lot, try incorporating similar gestures

### =F0=9F=91=82**  Follow the 2:1 rule**

Listening to someone drone on and on about themselves is exhausting.

As the saying goes, we have two ears but only one mouth - use them in that =
ratio, and listen twice as much as you speak. This is surprisingly key to b=
uilding rapport: sit back and do _less_ of the talking?!=C2=A0

But it works.

And remember, when you=E2=80=99re listening, __actually__ be curious about =
the other person. Instead of just waiting for your turn to speak, ask them =
follow-up questions about what they=E2=80=99ve said.

### =F0=9F=94=8E**  Show you=E2=80=99re **__**really**__** listening**

This is kinda an expansion of the last point.

One simple way to do this is by using the person's name. As Dale Carnegie f=
amously said, "A person's name is to that person the sweetest and most impo=
rtant sound in any language."

So don't just use their name in greetings. Sprinkle it throughout the conve=
rsation:

* "I see what you mean, Tom. That must have been challenging."

* "Sarah, what do you think is the best approach here?"

Another powerful technique is to use callbacks. If someone shares a specifi=
c detail, bring it up later in the conversation (and, especially in future =
conversations).

### =F0=9F=A4=9D**  Find common ground**

Imagine you're meeting a client for the first time. How can you quickly bui=
ld rapport? One way is to ask general questions to find common ground:

* "I saw on LinkedIn that you've been at your company for 10 years. How=E2=
=80=99s the journey been?"

* "I read an article about how AI is transforming your industry. What's you=
r take on it?"

* "I noticed your office is in Chicago. I love that city! What's your favor=
ite thing to do there?"

The key is to ask open-ended questions that invite them to share. Look for =
opportunities to relate to what they say and share your own experiences.

When you find a topic that you're both passionate about, dive deeper. Ask f=
ollow-up questions and share your thoughts.

Caption:=20

### =F0=9F=98=AE**  Be **__**interesting**__**, not just interested**

When we meet someone new, most of us default to the same old boring small t=
alk.

* "How 'bout that weather?"

* "Got any plans for the weekend?"

Yawn. It's no wonder we struggle to build rapport. We're putting people to =

To really build rapport, be __interesting__. How? Bring up interesting thin=
gs about you, ask better questions and give your unique takes.

The goal is to be different and engaging. When you are, people will natural=
ly be drawn to you.

Before I wrap up, I need something from you.

**These emails take me freakin=E2=80=99 forever to write up**. And cost a l=
ot in email sending costs. But yet I don=E2=80=99t litter them with ads nor=
 paywall the best parts.=20

That said, there is a (non-monetary) fee for them:=20

If an email changes the way you think, opens your mind to a new perspective=
, or gives you an insight you get value from, please do one of these things=
:

1. **Tell a friend about these emails**. **[Here=E2=80=99s a link](https://=
link.resumeworded.com/share-the-email)** to share the series so they get th=
e next one, or tell them to go to _[Coached.com](http://Coached.com)__ to s=
ign up._

2. **Engage with me on ****[any of my recent LinkedIn posts](https://www.li=
nkedin.com/in/rohanmahtani/recent-activity/all/)** =E2=80=94=C2=A0if you li=
ke what I write here, you=E2=80=99ll enjoy that too.

3. **[Leave a review](https://resumeworded.com/leave-a-review-newsletter)**=
 for Coached.

Stuff like this helps and makes all the efforts feel worth it =E2=80=94=C2=
=A0thank you.=20

## How many jobs should you apply for in 2024?

_Read the full article __[here](https://resumeworded.com/how-many-jobs-shou=
ld-i-apply-for-key-advice)__._

A statistic that's often passed around is 1 callback for every 50 applicati=
ons. But we've found that this isn't accurate =E2=80=94 you can 5x the numb=
er of callbacks by making a few tweaks to each application.

**=F0=9F=97=A3=EF=B8=8F =C2=A0Avoid resume bombing. **Quality over quantity=
. Avoid sending out applications to jobs you might not be qualified for at =
all. Make sure you apply to jobs in your niche =E2=80=94 e.g. those related=
 to your major, industry, skillset, or level of seniority.

=F0=9F=8E=AF =C2=A0To make sure your resume is effective, upload your resum=
e to [this tool](https://resumeworded.com/score). It'll analyze each line o=
n your resume and tell you how to improve each one, so you'll get past the =
resume screeners and hiring managers.

=F0=9F=A7=90** =C2=A0Targeting your resume does not mean you have to rewrit=
e your resume for every single job. **Just tweak the skills section of your=
 resume at the minimum =E2=80=94 [this resume targeting tool](https://resum=
eworded.com/targeted-resume) will help. And use [this cover letter generato=
r](https://resumeworded.com/ai-cover-letter-generator) to create a unique c=
over letter per job application.

=F0=9F=93=88** =C2=A0Use niche job sites: **Avoid the Indeeds or Monsters o=
f the world. [Niche sites](https://resumeworded.com/best-sites-for-your-res=
ume-key-advice) have less competition.

----------## If you=E2=80=99re new here, hi!

Hey, I'm Rohan. Some people are into yoga, others are into fishing - me, I'=
m all about self-improvement. Years ago, I got fed up with the fluff that p=
asses for career advice out there. So, I started Resume Worded and this ema=
il series, Coached, to share the industry insider info I was learning.

Think of this email as your weekly dose of career coaching you didn't know =
you needed. No fluff, no platitudes, no-BS =E2=80=94 just real stuff that y=
ou need to hear to shape your career into what you want it to be.

Until next time,

**P. S.** To make sure your career never goes off the rails, don't miss my =
future emails. A simple way to make sure you get each email is:

1. If you're using Gmail, hit the 3 dots at the top-right corner, and choos=
e Move to -> Primary. Or drag this email to Primary if you're on your compu=
ter.

2. If you're using Apple Mail, tap on our email address at the top of this =
email (next to "From:" on mobile) and click =E2=80=9CAdd to VIPs.=E2=80=9D.
