sized, candid career advice for quick boosts throughout your week. It=E2=80=

 way to get a massive pay bump. If you like my writing, _[**follow me on Li=

----------## Why networking =E2=80=9Cdoesn=E2=80=99t work=E2=80=9D

In all my years writing these _Coached_ emails, there=E2=80=99s one thing t=
hat I=E2=80=99ve been harping on about again and again:

The power of networking.

Because (who you know) + (what you know) =3D a very promising career path.

But everytime I say this, there=E2=80=99s always people who complain:=C2=A0

=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve tried networking, but it never seems to work.=E2=80=
=9D

Hmmm.

Reminds me of people getting injured doing squats and then blaming the squa=
ts. (Hint hint: it=E2=80=99s not the squats that=E2=80=99re the problem, it=
=E2=80=99s the way you=E2=80=99re doing them that=E2=80=99s the problem.)

So today, let=E2=80=99s go over one of the usual suspects when it comes to =
bad networking =E2=80=9Cform=E2=80=9D:

**Looking in the wrong places.**

Because just like buying a house or going on a romantic picnic=E2=80=A6. th=
e most important thing with networking is _location, location, location_.

Let=E2=80=99s roll.

### =F0=9F=8C=B9**  Networking is like dating**

Imagine you=E2=80=99re on a quest to find the man or woman of your dreams t=
o marry and live happily ever after.=C2=A0

The first question would obviously be,

=E2=80=9CWhere should I start looking?=E2=80=9D

And the answer to that question is, - to use a Top Gun quote - in =E2=80=9C=
target-rich environments.=E2=80=9D (I.e places with lots of suitable candid=
ates).=C2=A0

Note: the key word here is =E2=80=9Csuitable.=E2=80=9D

Sure, there might be loads of singles in nightclubs, but if I=E2=80=99m loo=
king for someone who loves books and classical music=E2=80=A6 it=E2=80=99d =
be a huge waste of time.=20

(I=E2=80=99d be far better off joining a book club, attending a Ludovico Ei=
naudi concert, or, I dunno, going to a wine tasting.)

By the same token=E2=80=A6

If I=E2=80=99m looking to build a solid network, there=E2=80=99s certain pl=
aces I=E2=80=99d never go either.

For example:

### **=F0=9F=A4=8C=F0=9F=8F=BC  The bigger the badder**

Yeah, I know. Gatsby said something about liking big parties, because they=
=E2=80=99re more intimate than small ones. I get it.=C2=A0

But for networking?

I disagree.=C2=A0

IMO, networking at big events where thousands of people show up is always h=
arder, because a) it=E2=80=99s hard to break past small talk, and b) there=
=E2=80=99s that =E2=80=9Cbig city=E2=80=9D vibe going on where no-one _real=
ly_ wants to know who you are and what you do.=C2=A0

Sure, if you throw enough mud at the wall, something=E2=80=99s gonna stick.=
 But if I was you, I=E2=80=99d look for smaller, =E2=80=9Ccozier=E2=80=9D e=
vents where it=E2=80=99s not all name-tags and freebies.

### =F0=9F=A5=B1**  Avoid the generic**

Let=E2=80=99s say you=E2=80=99re a marketer and your speciality is running =
ads on TikTok.=C2=A0

**Don=E2=80=99t go to a generic =E2=80=98marketing event=E2=80=99 - find ev=
ents more =E2=80=9Cniche=E2=80=9D aimed at TikTok marketing**.

Why?=C2=A0

Think about it:

Which event gives you more =E2=80=9Cstatus=E2=80=9D (and will introduce you=
 to people of higher =E2=80=9Cstatus=E2=80=9D in your industry)?=20

An event put on for Joe-Schmoe? Or an event about the cutting edge of TikTo=
k analytics, where it feels like an exclusive club to attend?=C2=A0

----------
**=E2=80=A6by the way, if you use LinkedIn, **_**[go to my profile](https:/=

### **=F0=9F=8E=93  Steer clear of NewbieCon**

Some events are aimed at beginners, while some cater to seasoned pros.=C2=
=A0

Find the latter.

To tell which is which, look at the agenda.=20

Are the topics aimed at newbies (=E2=80=9CHow to build a Facebook page=E2=
=80=9D), or are they aimed at the big hitters (=E2=80=9CTactics that helped=
 scale our leads from 10k to 100k people a month=E2=80=9D)?

### =F0=9F=AB=80**  The anatomy of a successful networking relationship**

Before we dive into more networking no-nos, let's take a step back and cons=
ider what makes a networking relationship truly successful.

In my experience, the best networking relationships have three key componen=
ts:

1. Thoughtful conversation: You get past small talk, pleasantries and eleva=
tor pitches. Instead, you're having in-depth discussions about your industr=
y, your challenges, and your goals.

2. Mutual benefit: Both parties see value in the relationship.=20

3. Respect: You admire each other's work and expertise. There's no hidden a=
genda.

When you keep these components in mind, it becomes clear why certain networ=
king situations just don't work.

Take speed networking events, for example.

### =F0=9F=8F=83**  Speed networking events**

We=E2=80=99re back to the quantity over quality problem.

But also=E2=80=A6

The best relationships usually occur when both parties aren=E2=80=99t needy=
, and things happen organically as if it was =E2=80=9Cmeant to be.=E2=80=9D=
=C2=A0

=E2=80=9CSpeed networking=E2=80=9D is the antithesis of this. Everyone=E2=
=80=99s there to get something, and it=E2=80=99s very transactional.

I=E2=80=99m not saying it can=E2=80=99t work, it=E2=80=99s just very=E2=80=
=A6 inorganic.

There's no time for thoughtful conversation when you're being shuffled from=
 one person to the next every few minutes.

And it's hard to establish mutual benefit or respect when you barely have a=
 chance to scratch the surface of who someone is and what they do.

### =F0=9F=93=A2**  Avoid =E2=80=9CConferences=E2=80=9D**

When I worked in analytics, I was sent to a lot of different analytics =E2=
=80=9Cconferences=E2=80=9D.=C2=A0

But what I found out was=E2=80=A6

=E2=80=A6 they weren=E2=80=99t actually conferences. They were poorly disgu=
ised sales pitches designed to =E2=80=9Cconnect you=E2=80=9D with vendors.=
=C2=A0

I=E2=80=99ve seen the same with =E2=80=9Cfounder groups=E2=80=9D. Instead o=
f meeting like-minded entrepreneurs, it=E2=80=99s just sleazy sales people =
wanting to pitch you their product.=C2=A0

=3D> Does an event have a sponsor-list longer than the Dead Sea Scrolls?

Red flag. =F0=9F=9A=A9

And it's not just in-person events. The same thing happens in most online n=
etworking groups.

You join a LinkedIn/FB/etc group hoping to connect with people in your indu=
stry. But, all you see are people pitching their latest product or service.

Get out of those online groups and join those where there=E2=80=99s little =
to no advertising.

### **=E2=9A=BD  Ok, so where do I look?**

Here=E2=80=99s a thought:

Instead of looking for networking =E2=80=9Cevents=E2=80=9D... try to do a b=
it of low-key networking at the events you already go to (or that you=E2=80=
=99d be going to anyway).

For example=E2=80=A6

My friend=E2=80=99s built a lovely =E2=80=9Cnetwork=E2=80=9D through her ru=
nning team.=C2=A0Turns out there=E2=80=99s an intersection of people who wa=
nt to improve themselves fitness-wise that also want to improve themselves =
career-wise (_who knew?!_).

Think of the hobbies you do regularly (or which you could do regularly). Ar=
e you making an effort to speak to people there?=20

### =F0=9F=8C=90**  Don't limit yourself to IRL**

Networking events are great, but they're not the only way to grow your netw=
ork. Online is very effective too.

I say this from experience:

I=E2=80=99ve been posting career strategy on LinkedIn for about 7 months no=
w, and I=E2=80=99ve engaged with people in comments or through DMs (or thro=
ugh these emails!).=20

I=E2=80=99ve had those thoughtful conversations, without the time pressure =
or distractions of in-person events. And if you=E2=80=99re not following me=
 there yet, **[here=E2=80=99s a link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohanmaht=
ani/)** to my profile.

Before I wrap up, I need something from you.

**These emails take me freakin=E2=80=99 forever to write up**. And cost a l=
ot in email sending costs. But yet I don=E2=80=99t litter them with ads nor=
 paywall the best parts.

That said, there is a (non-monetary) fee for them:

If an email changes the way you think, opens your mind to a new perspective=
, or gives you an insight you get value from, please do one of these things=
:

1. **Tell a friend about these emails**. **[Here=E2=80=99s a link](https://=
link.resumeworded.com/share-the-email)** to share the series so they get th=
e next one, or tell them to go to _[Coached.com](http://Coached.com)__ to s=
ign up._

2. **Engage with me on ****[any of my recent LinkedIn posts](https://www.li=
nkedin.com/in/rohanmahtani/recent-activity/all/)** =E2=80=94=C2=A0if you li=
ke what I write here, you=E2=80=99ll enjoy what I write there too.

3. **[Leave a review](https://resumeworded.com/leave-a-review-newsletter)**=
 for Coached.

Stuff like this helps and makes all the efforts feel worth it =E2=80=94=C2=
=A0thank you.=20

## How to say you manage employees on your resume

_Read the full article __[here](https://resumeworded.com/manage-employees-o=
n-a-resume-key-advice)__._

=F0=9F=91=A8=F0=9F=8F=BC=E2=80=8D=F0=9F=8F=AB =C2=A0Whether you=E2=80=99re =
applying for high-level roles, are looking to move into a management positi=
on, or just want to take the next step up in your career, experience managi=
ng others is often vital.

=F0=9F=92=81=F0=9F=8F=BB =C2=A0Your ability to manage others shows strong l=
eadership and communication skills, all of which hiring managers look for o=
n resumes.

=F0=9F=A7=90 =C2=A0If you're struggling to come up with good ideas on what =
to add to your resume, add a bullet point highlighting a project or team yo=
u managed. For example:

* _Managed a process re-engineering project to improve and consolidate end-=
to-end service processes; restructured communication flow among 10 departme=
nts, and cut down paperwork by 75%_

* _Hired and trained team of six employees with two direct reports; promote=
d 6 months ahead of schedule_

=F0=9F=8E=AF =C2=A0**You should use a tool like ****[Score My Resume](https=
://resumeworded.com/resume-scanner)** **to find out if your resume shows en=
ough leadership skills**. One of the components of your resume's score is l=
eadership (among 20+ other recruiter checks), so it's a great litmus test t=
o see if you've checked this box. [Try it](http://resumeworded.com/free-res=
ume-review).

(Btw, don=E2=80=99t forget to try out the _Magic Write _feature within the =
tool, which will use AI to rewrite your bullet points and make them a whole=
 lot more impressive to recruiters).

----------## If you=E2=80=99re new here, hi!

Hey, I'm Rohan. Some people are into yoga, others are into fishing - me, I'=
m all about self-improvement. Years ago, I got fed up with the fluff that p=
asses for career advice out there. So, I started Resume Worded and this ema=
il series, Coached, to share the industry insider info I was learning.

Think of this email as your weekly dose of career coaching you didn't know =
you needed. No fluff, no platitudes, no-BS =E2=80=94 just real stuff that y=
ou need to hear to shape your career into what you want it to be.

Until next time,
