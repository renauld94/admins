Good morning. It's Rohan with your latest edition of _Coached_, your person=
al mentorship email that takes a few minutes to read, but contains stuff th=
at will speed up your career by years.

Today's _Mentor's Corner_ comes from an unexpected place: stand-up comedy. =
I know =E2=80=94 "_wtf does that have to do with my career_?" That's what I=
=E2=80=99d think too. But after trying it, I realized comedy isn't just an =
art =E2=80=94 it's a science. Comedians are way more technical than I imagi=
ned, and there are things they do that we can apply to work. I think you'll=
 enjoy the parallels I found.

Also, if you=E2=80=99re on a job search, don=E2=80=99t miss the LinkedIn ti=
ps I compiled at the beginning and the resume advice at the end of the emai=
l.

**New here?** If you like the sound of getting free career coaching every w=
eek =E2=80=94=C2=A0the kind people usually pay a lot for =E2=80=94=C2=A0get=
 my next email by signing up at _[Coached.com](http://Coached.com)_.

----------Before we get into it, here=E2=80=99s a snippet of a recent Linke=

----------## The work tricks I stole from stand-up comics

Ever since watching my first Chris Rock special, _Bring the Pain,_=C2=A0I=
=E2=80=99ve been a huge stand-up comedy fan.=C2=A0

On the one hand, it=E2=80=99s a great form of entertainment. But also, I re=
ckon it=C2=A0 benefits my career too: after a long stressful week, laughter=
 is the ultimate therapy.

That said=E2=80=A6

While I=E2=80=99ve enjoyed it from the side-lines, the prospect of actually=
 __doing__ stand-up comedy was terrifying.=C2=A0

(If public speaking is scarier than death, what does that say about public =
joke-telling?)

And that=E2=80=99s when I realized=E2=80=A6

If I was so scared of it, that meant only one thing:

**I **_**HAD**_** to try it.=C2=A0**

So that=E2=80=99s why, on a cold Thursday night in August last year, your =
=E2=80=98ol buddy Rohan trudged nervously into a hall for the first session=
 in a 3 month block of a stand-up comedy course.

I=E2=80=99m not gonna lie=E2=80=A6

Before most sessions=E2=80=A6 I was nervous.=C2=A0

Like, _really_ nervous.=C2=A0

But by the end of the 3-months, it turned out to be an amazing experience. =
And what=E2=80=99s more, it also taught me some very valuable =E2=80=9Cnugg=
ets=E2=80=9D for our careers too.

And that=E2=80=99s what I want to share with you in today=E2=80=99s issue o=
f _Coached_.

Let=E2=80=99s go.

----------
**=E2=80=A6by the way, if you use LinkedIn, **_**[go to my profile](https:/=
/www.linkedin.com/in/rohanmahtani/)**_** and hit the =E2=80=98Follow=E2=80=
=99 button**. I share a mix of practical career strategy and mid-week motiv=
ation =E2=80=94=C2=A0stuff that makes it easy to keep your career on track.=
=20

_**Topics coming up**_: how to get promoted faster than others, how to buil=
d instant rapport with people (even senior leaders) and how to sound more c=
onfident (even if you=E2=80=99re an introvert). _[See you there](https://ww=
w.linkedin.com/comm/mynetwork/discovery-see-all?usecase=3DPEOPLE_FOLLOWS&fo=
llowMember=3Drohanmahtani)_.

alright, let=E2=80=99s get back to my essay=E2=80=A6


----------### =F0=9F=8C=AA=EF=B8=8F**  Get to the point. Quick!**

All jokes are made up of two parts: a set-up, and a punchline. The set-up i=
s what =E2=80=98sets up=E2=80=99 the joke, the punchline is when the audien=
ce laughs.

For example, a Steve Martin classic:

* _Set-up_: I like a woman with a head on her shoulders.

* _Punchline_: I hate necks.=20

(Notice how the set-up=E2=80=99s important. Just saying =E2=80=98I hate nec=
ks=E2=80=99 isn=E2=80=99t funny on its own. Even though it=E2=80=99s the pa=
rt that makes people laugh.)

Now, here=E2=80=99s the thing to remember:=C2=A0

**The goal of standup is to be as concise as possible with the set-up**.

Because people=E2=80=99s attention spans are so low nowadays, if you start =
rambling, they=E2=80=99ll drift off and get lost for the punchline.

To show you what I mean, here=E2=80=99s two versions of a joke I just wrote=
 off the top of my head.=C2=A0

(I know it=E2=80=99s pretty lame - I tried to come up with something career=
-related to stress my point!)

_Version A:_

* _Set-up_: "After a week filled with back-to-back meetings, I finally must=
ered up the courage to tell my boss that I was feeling completely overwhelm=
ed with meetings and could really use some guidance on how to manage my tim=
e better..."

* _Punchline_: "He sent me a calendar invite for a 'Time Management' worksh=
op"

_Version B:_=C2=A0

* _Setup_: I told my boss I was feeling overwhelmed with meetings.=C2=A0

* _Punchline_: He sent me a calendar invite for a 'Time Management' worksho=
p.

(ba-dum-tshh)

Notice how the joke=E2=80=99s equally funny (if not more so) with a shorter=
 setup. With the long setup, the unnecessary details just water it down.=C2=
=A0

Now=E2=80=A6

#### _**What does this have to do with your career?**_

Well, short =E2=80=9Cset-ups=E2=80=9D **are just as important in the profes=
sional world**, **too**.

Which leads me to my next point:

### **=E2=9C=82=EF=B8=8F  Trim the fat!**

To be as efficient as possible with the =E2=80=9Cset-up=E2=80=9D, you have =
to be as _ruthless _as possible about trimming the fat.=C2=A0

=3D> whenever we=E2=80=99re writing an email, or designing a presentation, =
ask yourself:=C2=A0

=E2=80=9C**Is this word / sentence / paragraph necessary**?=E2=80=9D=C2=A0

If the answer=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cno,=E2=80=9D cut it!

Here=E2=80=99s a simple example of what I mean. I=E2=80=99ve trimmed the =
=E2=80=98fat=E2=80=99 with the struck out text:

* Hi Sarah,


=3D=3D~~I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base with you r=
egarding ~~=3D=3DCan we discuss the Q3 marketing budget =3D=3D~~that we bri=
efly mentioned in last week's meeting~~=3D=3D=3D=3D? =3D=3D=3D=3D~~I think =
it would be beneficial for us to~~=3D=3D=3D=3D =3D=3DLet's schedule a ~~qui=

 on our priorities~~=3D=3D!


=3D=3D~~Please let me know your availability for the coming week, and I'll =
set up a calendar invite accordingly.~~=3D=3D


I=E2=80=99m available Tuesday, 2-4 PM and Thursday, 10-11 AM.

The trimmed email looks like this:

* Hi Sarah,


Can we discuss the Q3 marketing budget? Let's schedule a 30-minute call!


I=E2=80=99m available Tuesday, 2-4 PM and Thursday, 10-11 AM.

I over-trimmed stuff to make my point. The earlier you are in your career, =
you need a couple more niceties, but drop them as you become more senior.

### **=E2=8F=B1=EF=B8=8F Master the elevator pitch**

Comics often need to explain their style in just a few seconds to land gigs=
. It's like the world's shortest, high-stakes elevator pitch.

In your career, you need this skill too. Can you summarize your project, yo=
ur role, or even your entire career in 30 seconds?

Practice this. It'll come in handy more often than you'd think =E2=80=93 wh=
ether you're networking, interviewing, or pitching ideas to senior leadersh=
ip.

### =F0=9F=8C=80**  Catch the rambler**

One area I really sharpened after I hung up my standup hat =E2=80=94 a dist=
inguished career, I know ;) =E2=80=94 was my speaking.

Specifically, I started rambling less during conversation. I became much be=
tter at catching myself going off on a tangent, and getting back on topic.

So my advice?

Try to catch yourself when you start to ramble, too.

**Especially in meetings. **Chances are, your ramblings are far less intere=
sting to the team than they are to you.

There's more I learned from stand-up that applies surprisingly well to our =
careers that I can share in a potential part 2. But tell me if I hit the ma=
rk with this one first.

And if you did enjoy reading this email=E2=80=A6

(I don=E2=80=99t ask you for a lot=E2=80=A6.rather, these emails are expens=
ive to send out, yet I keep them free and don=E2=80=99t clutter them with a=
ds)

Do me a favor and either:

1. **Tell a friend about these emails**. **[Here=E2=80=99s a link](https://=
link.resumeworded.com/share-the-email)** to share the series so they get th=
e next one, or tell them to go to _[Coached.com](http://Coached.com)__ to s=
ign up._

2. **Engage with me on ****[any of my recent LinkedIn posts](https://www.li=

3. **[Leave a review](https://resumeworded.com/leave-a-review-newsletter)**=

Stuff like this helps and makes all the efforts feel worth it =E2=80=94=C2=

## How to make your resume more accomplishment-oriented

_Read the full article __[here](https://elink.resumeworded.com/ss/c/gXrdGUJ=

TeykyE5vqNPJscBBLCMiHe9sM)__._

When friends come to me for help on their resumes, the biggest change I tel=
l them to make is to tweak their bullet points so they're focused on what t=
hey actually accomplished, and not generic stuff that was part of their job=
 (i.e. responsibilities). Here's the difference:

* **Responsibility (don't do this)**: _=E2=80=9CResponsible for creating de=
sign assets for the team=E2=80=9D_

Consider the statement above. It explains what you were tasked with, but no=
t how well you did it. It sounds like it was pulled straight from a job pos=
ting, which makes it too generic for a resume.

Here's what you could write instead =E2=80=94 it's an **accomplishment, som=
ething you actually achieved (do this!):**

* _Designed an email toolkit and style guide to enable teams to quickly bui=
ld mobile-responsive emails and maintain visual consistency; led to time sa=
vings of 5+ hours per week_

I'd recommend uploading your resume to _[Score My Resume](https://resumewor=
ded.com/score)_ to identify any mistakes on your resume that recruiters ten=
d to look out for. It'll check each of your bullet points and make sure the=
y're accomplishment-focused. [Try it](https://resumeworded.com/resume-scann=
er).=20

(Btw, don=E2=80=99t forget to try out the _Magic Write _feature within the =
tool, which will use AI to rewrite your bullet points and make them all acc=
omplishment-oriented).

Hey, I'm Rohan. Some people are into yoga, others are into fishing - me, I'=
m all about self-improvement. Years ago, I got fed up with the fluff that p=
asses for career advice out there. So, I started Resume Worded and this ema=
il series, Coached, to share the industry insider info I was learning.

Think of this email as your weekly dose of career coaching you didn't know =
you needed. No fluff, no platitudes, no-BS =E2=80=94 just real stuff that y=
ou need to hear to shape your career into what you want it to be.

Until next time,
