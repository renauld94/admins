Ok, friends, I=E2=80=99m back with another edition of _Coached_ =E2=80=94 y=
our personal mentorship email that takes a few minutes to read, but speeds =
up your career by years.

Today's _Mentor's Corner_ is about a skill that's never taught. But it=E2=
=80=99s what I think separates those who do well in senior roles from those=
 who struggle: the ability to deal with ambiguity and unknowns.

It=E2=80=99s something I=E2=80=99ve had to get a lot better at while starti=
ng/growing Resume Worded, so I=E2=80=99ll take you through what=E2=80=99s h=
elped me. Later in the email, I=E2=80=99ve also included some tips if you=
=E2=80=99re on a job search.

Finally, thank you to those who=E2=80=99ve been sharing my emails with thei=
r colleagues, clients and peers. It=E2=80=99s fulfilling to see them reach =
more people! If you enjoy my emails and think they could help others too, p=
lease _**[share them](https://resumeworded.com/workers/newsletter-share)**_=
**. **

----------## The skill you need to learn: dealing with ambiguity

Ok, so=E2=80=A6 I don=E2=80=99t wanna toot my own horn or anything, but at =
school, I was a pretty good student.

Most exams, for me, weren=E2=80=99t hard.=C2=A0

Not because I was smart, but because exams mostly were just a case of **mem=
orizing** my notes/text book, finding out the exact steps used to solve pas=
t exam problems, then **regurgitating** for the final exam.=20

And in university, I got away with doing the same thing. Well, apart from o=
ne class:

Dr. Roberts=E2=80=99 class.

You see, for Dr Roberts=E2=80=99 problem sets, he didn=E2=80=99t just use p=
revious problems and change the numbers. No. In fact, for _his_ assignments=
, he wouldn=E2=80=99t even give us problems similar to the ones we=E2=80=99=
d solved in class.=C2=A0

Instead, he=E2=80=99d create new problems with unusual twists. That we actu=
ally had to THINK about.

In other words.. rote-memorization was useless=E2=80=A6

And we had to use brain calories instead.

It was perhaps the most annoying, frustrating, **but most valuable and stim=
ulating **class I ever took at university. (I never did well in it either)

And not because of what I learned in it, necessarily.

But for the bigger lesson.

That sometimes=E2=80=A6

**You=E2=80=99re gonna have to deal with problems that don=E2=80=99t come g=
ift-wrapped with an instruction manual, or can be solved by a =E2=80=9Chow-=
to=E2=80=9D video on Youtube.**

_And it=E2=80=99s the ability to grapple with these problems - i.e __**with=
**__ __**ambiguity -**__ that separates the leaders in their field from the=
 followers._

And what, with rapid tech change opening up new frontiers at a crazy rate, =
I thought I=E2=80=99d devote this edition of _Coached_ to help you cultivat=
e this skill.

Let=E2=80=99s go.

### =F0=9F=A4=94**  Wait, what actually IS ambiguity?**

Ambiguity =3D the unknown.=20

In your career, it usually means open-ended problems with no clear right or=
 wrong answer.

It=E2=80=99s the difference between =E2=80=9Chow many orders do we have to =
fill this week,=E2=80=9D versus =E2=80=9Chow do we sell this new tech in Eu=
rope?=E2=80=9D

ni/).

alright, let=E2=80=99s get back to my essay=E2=80=A6


----------### =F0=9F=A7=A9**  Define the work**

Here=E2=80=99s a handy rule of thumb:

Your ability to deal with ambiguity =3D your ability to break down an open-=
ended problem with no clear answer into clearly-defined tasks.

View image: (https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Fkex--hlvhlEAwvkYzZ9kvXq7=
d8LDHhWLUtXK_ZrG7_4Z83RFa27eusGRg-sLbBzVhvd446_UU9eDASO4LiZTkY70HtJsQeuv6vB=
JdJZf1WaMgGVzZcp54783mZ3X-VgJUPS-ozvRciEphWRkGu0kpk)
Caption:=20

This is what I mean by =E2=80=9Cdefine the work=E2=80=9D.

Take =E2=80=9Chow do we sell this tech in Europe?=E2=80=9D, for example. Th=
at=E2=80=99s a huge question that=E2=80=99d need to be broken down question=
-by-question into a series of steps.

You might start by asking, =E2=80=9C which countries need (and want) our te=
ch the most?

And from there, you can define the work:

=3D> Get on the phone to European contacts, spend some time on the ground, =
hire an expert network to give you an overview of the market there, contact=
 regulatory bodies, book meetings with distributors etc etc.

**N.B:**

**As you increase in pay grade, the more work (particularly other people=E2=
=80=99s work) you=E2=80=99ll have to define.=C2=A0**

(A janitor defines only his own work, but a CEO defines the whole company=
=E2=80=99s work.)

=3D> The takeaway: Get better at defining and scoping out work.

ZVfOG9TvA-vROX0YNBoxveHqXKPYhQPCs8yj7uY-l0fyKTznC5yklnCKmWOv-JisfaxI5ZKTZ_g=
-nZkrjbyH8dUAc0GGRSEZLxHNaO_QRHrh5Qef0fdTU3tDx2q0PI)
Caption:=20

### =F0=9F=91=8F** Think (potential) solutions, not problems**

Piggy-backing off that last point:

Low-ranking employees pass ambiguity up to seniors. Seniors turn ambiguous =
problems into work for juniors.

=3D> _If you want to rise the ranks, don=E2=80=99t just take problems to yo=
ur seniors_. Invest some brain calories, and come up with a possible soluti=
on yourself, and _then _take it to your senior.

Specifically, when approaching people or seniors to get guidance:

* =E2=9D=8C=C2=A0Bad: Don't just say, "How do I do this?"

* =E2=9C=85=C2=A0Good: Instead, try: "I ran into X issue. My plan would be =

### =F0=9F=8C=90**  No Google allowed**

A habit I find useful:

Whenever I want to know the answer to something, I=E2=80=99ll try to work i=
t out myself first.=C2=A0

For example, "How long is the flight from New York City to Tokyo?"

I've never flown that route, but I know flying from NYC to London takes aro=
und 7 hours, and London is about halfway between NYC and Tokyo. So doubling=
 that time, I'd estimate the flight to Tokyo to be around 14 hours.

_checks Google_

11 hours?! Wow, my reasoning sucks!=C2=A0

**But that's useful. Now I know that some of my underlying assumptions must=
 be wrong**. And we've gotten better at asking the right questions when amb=
iguous.

Don't be too lazy to think.

### =F0=9F=93=8A**  Plan for a range of outcomes**

I learned this one playing hours of poker when I was in college (more on th=
is in a future email!):

Since you never know your opponent=E2=80=99s cards, you have to constantly =
analyze best and worst case scenarios and plan for different outcomes.=C2=
=A0

**Remember:**

**Ambiguities in the inputs =3D ambiguities in the outputs**.

### =F0=9F=94=8D**  Go to the source for data**

(aka: reducing the ambiguity!)

One of the most common career questions I get: =E2=80=9CShould I switch car=
eers to X?=E2=80=9D

My answer is always: get more information from the source. Speak to people =
in X industry, find out if it=E2=80=99s the kind of work you=E2=80=99ll enj=
oy and if it=E2=80=99s worth pursuing.

This is something you should make a habit of doing at work too. Let's say y=
ou're a product manager wondering if users like a new feature you've releas=
ed. Don't just rely on second-hand reports or assumptions. Dive into the gr=
anular survey data and user feedback directly.=20

### =F0=9F=A7=AA**  Conduct mini-experiments**

In many cases, you won=E2=80=99t be able to eliminate all the ambiguity. Th=
ere=E2=80=99s always going to be some =E2=80=9Cfog of war=E2=80=9D.=C2=A0

So the best thing to do is make a mini-experiment, and then adjust as you g=
o.=C2=A0

Example 1:=20

Let's say you're a marketing manager tasked with increasing brand awareness=
. There's ambiguity around which channels will be most effective. Instead o=
f going all-in on one strategy, run small tests. Put a small budget behind =
one, then double down on what works.

Example 2:

You=E2=80=99re unsure if a career change is right for you. So, volunteer or=
 work part-time in evenings and weekends at the job you want, then back off=
 or dive in based on whether you like it.

Before I wrap up, I need something from you.

These emails take me freakin=E2=80=99 forever to write up. And cost a lot i=
n email sending costs. But yet I don=E2=80=99t litter them with ads nor pay=

If an email changes the way you think, opens your mind to a new perspective=
, or gives you an insight you get value from, please do one of these things=
:

2. **Engage with me on ****[any of my recent LinkedIn posts](https://www.li=

## Why and how you should quantify your resume

_Read the full article __[here](https://resumeworded.com/how-to-quantify-re=
sume-key-advice)__._

When friends come to me for help on their resumes, the most impactful chang=
e I tell them to make is to use specific hard numbers when talking about th=
eir accomplishments.

I'll use an example to explain...

Here's a _bad_ line I might see on a resume:

* =E2=9D=8C_** =C2=A0**__=E2=80=9CExcellent creativity and design skills"_

This is a pretty biased statement. Just because you say you have excellent =
design skills doesn't mean a hiring manager is going to believe you.

Let's transform this by using hard numbers and being more specific:

* =E2=9C=85 =C2=A0"Designed an email toolkit and style guide to enable team=
s to quickly build mobile-responsive emails and maintain visual consistency=
; led to time savings of 5+ hours per week"

Note how we use a hard number, specifically the _time you saved_, to show h=
iring managers how our work made an impact on our employer.

This is called 'quantifying' your bullet points. Hard numbers support your =
narrative and, on your resume, make your skills undebatable.

=F0=9F=8E=AF =C2=A0You should use a tool like [Score My Resume](https://res=
umeworded.com/score) to find out if your resume is effective enough. It'll =
analyze each line on your resume, plus the Magic Write feature will give yo=
u ideas on how to quantify your bullet points, _even if you haven't worked =
in a sales role or don't have access to numbers_.

Hey, I'm Rohan. Some people are into yoga, others are into fishing - me, I'=

asses for career advice out there. So, I started Resume Worded and this ema=
il series, Coached, to share the industry insider info I was learning.

Think of this email as your weekly dose of career coaching you didn't know =
you needed. No fluff, no platitudes, no-BS =E2=80=94 just real stuff that y=
ou need to hear to shape your career into what you want it to be.

Until next time,
