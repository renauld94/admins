----------## How to build your reputation at work

A long time ago, in a university far far away, my friend (you=E2=80=99re pr=
obably reading this, hey Rob!) told me to read _The Count of Monte Cristo_ =
by Alexandre Dumas.=C2=A0

=E2=80=9CWhat, is it good?=E2=80=9D I ask.

=E2=80=9CDude, it=E2=80=99s the quintessential revenge novel.=E2=80=9D (His=
 exact words.)

Intrigued, I bought it.

And Rob was right. It __is__ the quintessential revenge novel.=C2=A0

The story:

A young sailor named Edmond gets set-up (and sent to an island prison to di=
e w/o trial) for a crime he didn=E2=80=99t commit. After 14 miserable years=
, Edmond escapes and plots to take his revenge using the vast fortune he fi=
nds via clues given to him by his cellmate.

The only problem?

By that time he gets out, the three men who set him up are some of the most=
 powerful people in France.

So what does Edmond do?

He fashions a new persona for himself - The Count of Monte Cristo - and dec=
ides he must infiltrate his enemies=E2=80=99 social circle so that they com=
e to trust him, and with that trust, destroy them utterly.

Of course, the only way he can reach those rungs of Parisian society?

**By building his reputation.=C2=A0**

(How he does this is genius - read the book)=C2=A0

Now=E2=80=A6

I know you're not looking to rise to the top of society to exact terrible r=
evenge on the guy who stole your lunch money. (I hope)

But, if your goal is to rise to the top of your company, industry, or just =
to enjoy more respect at work, **building your reputation is just as import=
ant.**

Question is..

How do you do it?

Well, here=E2=80=99s 5 things to keep in mind:

### =E2=8F=B3**  **_**Value people=E2=80=99s time**_

The other day, I saw this on Twitter:

View image: (https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VQXcj3X7Jnau7o_1lfJVezgGy=
Jjs4z_Rvz2SHyNSA-Vr0U3yfsYLsqbEw9ypiEbOGtcmtre5CEe9C6Aa17VvQ4tDhXQ0kS6AOncm=
Mv-h7T7bfdbQXZvIUcPyz9pz_-5-TmueajblUwEbPF_XQFR9jik)
Caption:=20

So. darn. true.

If you respect other people=E2=80=99s time by=E2=80=A6showing up on time, d=
elivering things on time, and cutting the flab out of needlessly long meeti=
ngs? Your colleagues and superiors are going to notice.

Also, let people know when a meeting is optional =E2=80=94 give people an e=
asy out if they don=E2=80=99t need to be there.

### =F0=9F=AA=A3**  **_**Ditch =E2=80=9Cbuckets=E2=80=9D where possible**_

There=E2=80=99s two ways of collecting water:=C2=A0 grab a bucket which you=
=E2=80=99ll need to do over and over, OR, put in the effort to build a pump=
, meaning you=E2=80=99ll never need a bucket again.

If you want to earn =E2=80=9Ccredit=E2=80=9D at work, replace as many =E2=
=80=9Cbucket-jobs=E2=80=9D with pumps.=C2=A0

For example:

You and your colleagues are **always** rifling through email conversations =
to find important documents. Build a system for this by compiling a handy =
=E2=80=9Cmother=E2=80=9D document.

Some other ideas:

* Create a shared portal or knowledge base for key documents and questions =
that people keep having.

* Develop an interactive dashboard or report for metrics your team or manag=
er needs.

* If you notice the same documents being created again and again, create a =
reusable template that saves everyone time.

By building these "pumps", you'll show that you're not just there to do the=
 bare minimum, but to make a real, lasting impact. That's how you build a s=
trong rep, and one of a problem-solver.

### =F0=9F=A4=BC**  **_**Don=E2=80=99t wrestle with pigs**_

There=E2=80=99s an old proverb that says,=C2=A0

=E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t wrestle with pigs. You=E2=80=99ll both get dirty but=
 the pig likes it.=E2=80=9D

In other words, avoid getting sucked into petty office politics and drama. =
There=E2=80=99s zero upside, and a lot of potential downside.

On the flipside, be the person who compliments others when they're not arou=
nd. When a colleague's name comes up, say something genuinely nice about th=
eir work or character.

If you're a manager, this is especially important. Make a habit of praising=
 your team members when they're not in the room. When word gets around (and=
 it will), it builds trust and shows people you've got their back.

Getting involved in office politics and gossip erodes trust. But consistent=
ly being a positive voice? That's how you build a reputation as someone peo=
ple can rely on and want to work with.

### =F0=9F=91=A9=F0=9F=8F=BB=E2=80=8D=F0=9F=92=BB**  **_**Do your job**_

Kinda goes without saying, but just showing up, and being reliably good at =
your job is _the_ most solid way of building your reputation.

On the flipside, if you=E2=80=99re atrocious at what you do, it doesn=E2=80=

### =F0=9F=99=8B=E2=80=8D=E2=99=82=EF=B8=8F**  **_**Take extreme ownership*=
*_

Jocko Willink tells this story in his book, _Extreme Ownership_, of how he =
was leading an operation in Iraq that took a major turn for the worse when =
two of his platoons radioed in that they were under heavy fire, and needed =
back-up asap.

But as it turns out?

Because of poor planning, the two platoons _had _(unknowingly)_ been attack=
ing each other_! (Luckily, none of his SEALs were hurt, but they could=E2=
=80=99ve easily been killed.)

Afterwards, in the mission debrief, his superiors understandably want blood=
.=C2=A0

_Who=E2=80=99s fault was this?_=C2=A0

So what does Jocko do?

He stands up and says, =E2=80=9CYou know whose fault this is? It was MY fau=
lt. I=E2=80=99m the leader of this mission, and everything that happens res=
ts with me.=E2=80=9D

Now=E2=80=A6

_What do you think happened to his reputation afterwards?_

Here=E2=80=99s what:

**He got more trust from his superiors, and more respect from his subordina=
tes. Because he didn=E2=80=99t try to pass the buck.**

So, how about you?=C2=A0

Do you play the blame game at work? Or, are you taking ownership?

**=E2=80=A6by the way, if you use LinkedIn, **_**[go to my profile](https:/=

alright, let=E2=80=99s get back to my essay=E2=80=A6


----------That=E2=80=99s a wrap for today. These emails take me freakin=E2=
=80=99 forever to put together and cost a lot in email sending costs. But I=
 keep the whole thing free, without sleazy =E2=80=98pay to read the rest of=
 it!=E2=80=99 type of stuff. So in return, **here=E2=80=99s the =E2=80=98fe=
e=E2=80=99**:

If an email changes the way you think, opens your mind to a new perspective=
, or gives you an insight you get value from, do one of these:

1. Tell a friend about these emails. **[Here=E2=80=99s a link](https://link=
.resumeworded.com/share-the-email)** to share the series so they get the ne=
xt one, or tell them to go to _[Coached.com](http://Coached.com)__ to sign =
up._

2. Engage with me on **[any of my recent LinkedIn posts](https://www.linked=

## How to target your resume to a job

_Read the full article ___[here](https://resumeworded.com/blog/targeted-res=
ume-how-to-tailor-your-resume-to-a-job/)___._

Some people say you should make a new resume for each job you apply to. If =
you had all the time in the world, then, yes, that=E2=80=99s a good idea.=20

But most of us don=E2=80=99t and want to be more efficient. If that=E2=80=
=99s you, do these two things instead:

#### **=E2=9C=B4 If you don=E2=80=99t have a lot of time, edit just your sk=
ills section**

This is the quickest way to target your resume. Look at the job description=
 you apply to, pick out core skills, and update your skills section with th=
e ones you have. This helps you get past the ATS, especially if the recruit=
ers are looking out for any specific skills.

To make this easier, use a tool like _[Targeted Resume](http://resumeworded=
.com/targeted-resume)_ to automatically find which core ATS skills you=E2=
=80=99re missing (based on the job you're applying to).

#### **=E2=9A=A1 Create 3-5 resume versions for the sub-fields you are targ=
eting**

Create one for each 'job type' you are applying for. For example, if you=E2=
=80=99re applying for marketing roles, you might have a resume:

* targeting sales and account management roles, highlighting your experienc=
e speaking to customers

* aimed at branding and design roles, highlighting your creative experience=
 and tools you=E2=80=99ve used like Canva and Photoshop

* targeting more user acquisition or media buying roles=20

=F0=9F=8E=AF By the way, _if you haven't yet used _[_Score My Resume_](http=
s://resumeworded.com/score)_ to get an instant resume review, do that first=
_. The tool will scan your resume for key things hiring managers look for a=
nd tell you where it falls short.=20

----------## If you=E2=80=99re new here, let=E2=80=99s get the intros out o=
f the way.

I'm Rohan. Six years ago, I found myself frustrated with the sea of mislead=
ing career advice online, so I started Resume Worded. The goal was simple: =
provide guidance that actually works.

But resumes were only the tip of the iceberg. There was a lot of clich=C3=
=A9d, generic career advice out there. So, I started this email series, _Co=
ached_. Each week, I talk about real career strategy, informed not only by =
my experiences but by my conversations with industry leaders, senior coache=
s who train CEOs, and people with way more experience than I have.

Every email you receive is written by me, not a ghostwriter. I'm here, on t=
he other end, reading your replies.

Until next time,

**P. S.** To make sure your career never goes off the rails, don't miss my =
future emails. A simple way to make sure you get each email is:

1. If you're using Gmail, hit the 3 dots at the top-right corner, and choos=
e Move to -> Primary. Or drag this email to Primary if you're on your compu=
ter.

2. If you're using Apple Mail, tap on our email address at the top of this =
email (next to "From:" on mobile) and click =E2=80=9CAdd to VIPs.=E2=80=9D.
