----------## How to become a better negotiator (in just 5 minutes)

_How do you get what you want in life?=C2=A0_

(Whether that be money, a good relationship, a satisfying career, or your 4=
-year old to eat his vegetables?)

Well=E2=80=A6

If what you want involves _other people_ (which most things do), then a lot=
 of it boils down to just one skill:

**Negotiation.**

Persuading your boss to give you a raise, convincing your partner to go to =
Greece on holiday, or even getting someone to come back from the brink when=
 they=E2=80=99re trying to jump off a bridge and end it all=E2=80=A6

It all comes down to negotiation.

The sad part?

Despite being a fundamental life skill, most people spend their lives _**bu=
tchering **_it.

So today, I wanted to give you 4 quick tips for how to get better at negoti=
ation.=C2=A0

Let=E2=80=99s go.

### =F0=9F=91=82**  The all-important =E2=80=9CC=E2=80=9D word**

Charlie Munger, the eclectic business partner of maybe the greatest investo=
r of all time, Warren Buffett, said something brilliant:

_=E2=80=9CI never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don=E2=
=80=99t know the other side=E2=80=99s argument better than they do.=E2=80=
=9D_

In other words=E2=80=A6

If Charlie wanted to be religious, he=E2=80=99d have to defend atheism bett=
er than an atheist. And if Charlie wanted to go paleo, he=E2=80=99d have to=
 argue for veganism better than vegans do.=C2=A0

It=E2=80=99s a brilliant principle=E2=80=A6

And one that brings us to our first negotiation tip:

**Be **_**Curious**_** about the other party!**

Do you know what the other side _really_ wants? Do you know what the other =
side really _does NOT_ want?

Think about asking for a raise. Many people walk in with a number in mind a=
nd start listing reasons why they deserve it.=20

But what if your boss is more concerned about the company's tight budget? O=
r they're worried about maintaining pay equity across the team?

By being curious and asking questions first, you might discover that propos=
ing a phased increase over time or suggesting a bonus tied to specific comp=
any milestones could be more effective than just asking for a flat raise. Y=
our questions might reveal opportunities you hadn't considered.

3lchb90797c1_copy__1_.png?t=3D1721236557)
Caption: or you can just trust WikiHow and try this =F0=9F=A4=A3

If you don=E2=80=99t know what the other party wants, you=E2=80=99re going =
to be in an incredibly poor negotiating position, bringing us to principle =
#2:

----------
**=E2=80=A6by the way, if you use LinkedIn, **_**[go to my profile](https:/=
/www.linkedin.com/in/rohanmahtani/)**_** and hit the =E2=80=98Follow=E2=80=
=99 button**. I share a mix of practical career strategy and mid-week motiv=
ation =E2=80=94=C2=A0stuff that makes it easy to keep your career on track.=
=20

_**Topics coming up**_: how to get promoted faster than others, how to conn=
ect with recruiters, and how to build instant rapport with people (even sen=
ior leaders). _[See you there](https://www.linkedin.com/comm/mynetwork/disc=
overy-see-all?usecase=3DPEOPLE_FOLLOWS&followMember=3Drohanmahtani)_.

alright, let=E2=80=99s get back to my essay=E2=80=A6


----------### =F0=9F=A4=9D**  Cupid beats Compromise**

When we=E2=80=99re negotiating, our default reasoning mode is =E2=80=9Ccomp=
romise=E2=80=9D. We want 50. They say 30. So we meet in the middle at 40, r=
ight?

But here=E2=80=99s the thing:

**Compromise doesn=E2=80=99t work if you don=E2=80=99t know what the other =
party wants.**

I mean, imagine it:

=E2=80=9CHow would you like to buy our grass-fed steaks?=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CUmmm, I=E2=80=99m a vegan. I don=E2=80=99t eat meat.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CHow about we knock off 50% then?=E2=80=9D

That would be _delusional_, and shows how compromise can actually __insult_=
_ the person you=E2=80=99re negotiating with.

A better approach?

The =E2=80=9C**Cupid**=E2=80=9D approach:

_**Find out what their heart truly desires, **___**then**___** negotiate**_=
.

People in a negotiation don't always want the same thing. (Remember this. W=
rite this down somewhere. Then underline it twice.)

**Some examples**=E2=80=A6

Say you=E2=80=99ve written a book and you=E2=80=99re negotiating with a mov=
ie studio. You might just want money, but they might care more about the ri=
ghts to use your characters in video games or action figures =E2=80=93 thin=
gs you might not care about.=20

By knowing this, you can offer them more of what _they_ want and get more o=
f what _you_ want (in this case, money).=C2=A0

In your career, this matters. Let's say you're negotiating for a new job. Y=
ou might be intensely focused on salary, but your potential employer might =
be very concerned about start date, leadership gaps, or your availability.

By understanding their priorities, you could get a higher salary by offerin=
g to:

* Start sooner

* Take on managerial responsibilities

* Sometimes work flexible hours to speak to their team in Australia

It's not about compromise, it's about finding what each party values most.

Caption: (a classic from The Office=E2=80=A6and it=E2=80=99s a common recru=
iter tactic to offer random benefits instead of things you want; they=E2=80=
=99re just using the same negotiation tactics on you and trying to figure o=
ut other things you might want)

__How do you find out what people want?__

Try this:

### =F0=9F=A7=94**  Ask =E2=80=9CChris Voss=E2=80=9D questions**

_=E2=80=9CI can=E2=80=99t. It=E2=80=99s not in our budget.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0_

A rookie mistake here is replying, =E2=80=9CWhy?=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CWhy n=
ot?=E2=80=9D, which puts people on the defensive and turns negotiation into=
 confrontation.=C2=A0

_(=E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t want to go to Mexico on holiday.=E2=80=9D_

_=E2=80=9CWhy?=E2=80=9D_

_=E2=80=9CI just don=E2=80=99t, okay!=E2=80=9D)_

Instead, ask what Chris Voss, the FBI=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cgo-to=E2=80=9D neg=
otiator in high-stakes hostage situations, calls a =E2=80=9Cmirroring quest=
ion=E2=80=9D:

=E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t want to go to Mexico on holiday.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CYou don=E2=80=99t want to go to Mexico on holiday?=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CYeah, it just.. I dunno, I think I=E2=80=99d rather stay at home a=
nd spend time with family, you know.=E2=80=9D

To do this, repeat what they=E2=80=99ve just said 1) _as a question_, and 2=
) _with a rising tone at the end._ It=E2=80=99ll come across as **curiosity=
** (not hostility), which=E2=80=99ll make them naturally open up and tell y=
ou what they=E2=80=99re thinking.=C2=A0

Here are some examples you can use at work:

* If a colleague says, "I don't think your idea will work for our team," mi=
rror back with, "_You don't think it will work for our team?_" This=E2=80=
=99ll get them to elaborate on their concerns, letting you address them dir=
ectly.

* When a client tells you, "This proposal is too expensive," try echoing, "=
_The proposal is too expensive?_" They=E2=80=99d usually then reveal more d=
etails of why which will allow you to tailor something to them.

Ok, last tip:

### =F0=9F=8C=A1=EF=B8=8F**  Let off the pressure**

Imagine you get a cold call from a stranger. Which opening question would m=
ake you feel more pressured:

_A) Hey, you got a few minutes?_
_B) Hey, is this a terrible time to talk?_

If you=E2=80=99re like me, Question A makes you feel way more pressured.

Why?

**Because****it=E2=80=99s trying to get you to do something**.=C2=A0

Question B, on the other hand, puts very little pressure on you because it =
gives you a very easy =E2=80=9Cout=E2=80=9D by almost assuming a =E2=80=9Cn=
o=E2=80=9D (_which ironically makes you more likely to hear what the guy=E2=
=80=99s got to say.)_

So remember:

=E2=80=9CNo-orientated=E2=80=9D questions reduce pressure, whereas =E2=80=
=9Cyes-oriented=E2=80=9D questions increase pressure.

* **Bad**: Can we talk about salary?

* **Good**: Would it be a terrible time to talk about salary?

I hope that helps you feel more prepared for the next negotiation you find =
yourself in. You might not need this right away, so consider starring or bo=
okmarking this email, and refer back to it when you need it most."

Before I wrap up, I need something from you.

**These emails take me freakin=E2=80=99 forever to write up **(particularly=
 this one!). And cost a lot in email sending costs. But yet I don=E2=80=99t=
 litter them with ads nor paywall the best parts.

That said, there is a (non-monetary) fee for them:

_If an email changes the way you think, opens your mind to a new perspectiv=
e, or gives you an insight you get value from_, do one of these things**:**

1. **Tell a friend about these emails**. **[Here=E2=80=99s a link](https://=
link.resumeworded.com/share-the-email)** to share the series so they get th=
e next one, or tell them to go to _[Coached.com](http://Coached.com)__ to s=
ign up._

2. **Engage with me on ****[any of my recent LinkedIn posts](https://www.li=
nkedin.com/in/rohanmahtani/recent-activity/all/)** =E2=80=94=C2=A0if you li=
ke what I write here, you=E2=80=99ll enjoy what I write there too.

3. **[Leave a review](https://resumeworded.com/leave-a-review-newsletter)**=
 for Coached.

Stuff like this helps and makes all the efforts feel worth it =E2=80=94=C2=
=A0thank you.=20

## Actionable ways to update your resume in 2024

_Read the full article __[here](https://resumeworded.com/blog/update-resume=
/)__._

This article has a list of actionable things you should do if you're updati=
ng your resume after a while. Here are two suggestions from the article:

=F0=9F=93=88** Use numbers to quantify your resume.**

Try to add hard numbers into each of your resume's bullet points. For examp=
le, if you say you worked with data, be specific and describe how big the d=
ataset was (in terms of rows, attributes or columns).

=F0=9F=8D=BE** =C2=A0Highlight promotions.**

Hiring managers want to see evidence of career progression on your resume, =
especially if you=E2=80=99re applying for mid-level and up roles.

=F0=9F=8E=AF =C2=A0If you haven't yet, you should probably use a tool like =
[Score My Resume](http://resumeworded.com/score) that's designed to help yo=
u update your existing resume. It'll tell you if your resume can be read by=
 resume screeners, as well as if it passes key criteria recruiters look for=
. [Try it here](http://resumeworded.com/score).

----------## If you=E2=80=99re new here, hi!

Hey, I'm Rohan. Some people are into yoga, others are into fishing - me, I'=
m all about self-improvement. Years ago, I got fed up with the fluff that p=
asses for career advice out there. So, I started Resume Worded and this ema=
il series, Coached, to share the industry insider info I was learning.

Think of this email as your weekly dose of career coaching you didn't know =
you needed. No fluff, no platitudes, no-BS =E2=80=94 just real stuff that y=
ou need to hear to shape your career into what you want it to be.

Until next time,
