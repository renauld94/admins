Ok, friends, it=E2=80=99s me, Rohan, with the latest _Coached_ =E2=80=94 yo=
ur personal mentorship email that takes a few minutes to read, but speeds u=
p your career by years.

Have you ever wondered why two people can face the same challenge, but resp=
ond in completely different ways? In today=E2=80=99s _Mentor's Corner_, I'v=
e been pondering this question, and I think I've identified a key factor th=
at often goes overlooked: the power of our =E2=80=98beliefs=E2=80=99. Also,=
 if you=E2=80=99re on a job search, read the resume advice in the bottom ha=
lf of the email.

**To my loyal readers**: If you=E2=80=99re not following me on LinkedIn yet=
, I share bite-sized, candid career advice on there pretty regularly. Peopl=
e tell me they can=E2=80=99t believe it=E2=80=99s free and that they=E2=80=
=99ve learned a lot about how to manage their careers =E2=80=94 from negoti=
ating better to spotting the right opportunities. _**[Follow me on LinkedIn=
](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohanmahtani/)**_.

**New here?** If you like the sound of getting free career coaching every w=
eek =E2=80=94=C2=A0the kind people usually pay a lot for =E2=80=94=C2=A0get=
 my next email by signing up at _[Coached.com](http://Coached.com)_.

_Estimated read time: 5 minutes 56 seconds_

----------
=E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=

=E2=80=94=E2=80=94


--------------------

----------## The =E2=80=9CX-factor=E2=80=9D secretly shaping our lives & ca=
reers

Here=E2=80=99s a question:

What decides whether you =E2=80=9Cwin=E2=80=9D at life & in your career or =
=E2=80=9Close=E2=80=9D? (No matter what your definition of =E2=80=9Cwinning=
=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Closing=E2=80=9D is)

Is it money?=C2=A0

Connections?

Knowledge?

Wisdom?=C2=A0

Willpower?

Honesty?=C2=A0

Hard work?

All these obviously help.=C2=A0

But what if I told you it wasn=E2=80=99t any of these things?=C2=A0

What if I told you _there=E2=80=99s an =E2=80=9CX-factor=E2=80=9D_ operatin=
g behind the scenes that secretly determines who you date, the company you =
work for, the money you earn, the work you do, how much crap you take from =
your boss=E2=80=A6 and even things like how =E2=80=9Cpopular=E2=80=9D you a=
re in the office, the clothes you wear, the body you have and the neighbour=
hood you live in.

Well, believe it or not, there is such an =E2=80=9CX-factor=E2=80=9D.

_**Your beliefs**_.=C2=A0

Because your beliefs are the =E2=80=9Clens=E2=80=9D through which you see t=
he world. And while your =E2=80=9Clens=E2=80=9D might not determine reality=
, it _**does**_ determine _**your**_ reality.

So, how do we change our beliefs then?

Well, here=E2=80=99s what you=E2=80=99ve got to know first:

----------
**=E2=80=A6by the way, if you use LinkedIn, **_**[go to my profile](https:/=
/www.linkedin.com/in/rohanmahtani/)**_** and hit the =E2=80=98Follow=E2=80=
=99 button**. I share a mix of practical career strategy and mid-week motiv=
ation =E2=80=94=C2=A0stuff that makes it easy to keep your career on track.=
=20

_**Topics coming up**_: how to get promoted faster than others, how to buil=
d instant rapport with people (even senior leaders) and how to sound more c=
onfident (even if you=E2=80=99re an introvert). _[See you there](https://ww=
w.linkedin.com/comm/mynetwork/discovery-see-all?usecase=3DPEOPLE_FOLLOWS&fo=
llowMember=3Drohanmahtani)_.

alright, let=E2=80=99s get back to my essay=E2=80=A6


----------### =F0=9F=8C=AA=EF=B8=8F**  The Cycle of Cycles**

What we need to remember is this:

**Belief =E2=86=92 Action =E2=86=92 Results (=E2=86=92 Belief).**

To explain, take the movie =E2=80=9CThe Shawshank Redemption=E2=80=9D.=C2=
=A0

Because Andy _believes_ he can escape prison, he takes _action_ by slowly d=
igging a tunnel, which eventually lets him escape. (The _result_).=20

Andy=E2=80=99s friend, Red, on the other hand, believes that hope is pointl=
ess, so takes no action to begin with, gets no results, which further cemen=
ts his hopelessness.

Remember:

Beliefs determine actions, actions determine results, and results reinforce=
 your belief. In this way, _**beliefs become self-fulfilling prophecies.**_

t=3Dauto,onerror=3Dredirect,quality=3D80/uploads/asset/file/5e823a6a-e44b-4=
9c8-8e3d-389d6d68762a/image__59___1_.png?t=3D1718290258)

Another example:

If you don=E2=80=99t_ ___believe___ _you=E2=80=99re =E2=80=9Cleader materia=
l=E2=80=9D...

=3D> You don=E2=80=99t sign up for leadership courses.

=3D> When you=E2=80=99re put in a leadership position, you fail.

=3D> Your belief that =E2=80=9Cyou=E2=80=99re not leadership material=E2=80=
=9D gets stronger.=20

**And here=E2=80=99s where it gets worse. **

Once you believe you=E2=80=99re _**not**_ a good leader, you think =E2=80=
=9C_I failed last time, so it=E2=80=99s probably not going to work this tim=
e_=E2=80=9D, so you=E2=80=A6

* Take even LESS action=20

* Take even LESS initiative to become a leader

* Get even WORSE results (because you aren=E2=80=99t taking any initiative =
to get better)

* =3D> which WORSENS your belief even further (=E2=80=A6and repeat)

It=E2=80=99s what I call a negative downwards spiral.

On the flipside, take my friend Becca.=C2=A0

3 years ago, she seemed super shy on the surface and had never led a team b=
efore.=20

BUT, she _**believed**_ leadership was a skill she could improve. She knew =
she could do it, so she took _**action**_.

=3D> She bought and read leadership books.=20

=3D> She asked her manager if she could lead more meetings. She volunteered=
 to lead high priority meetings whenever her manager was too busy.=20

She noticed herself becoming more confident and comfortable in leadership s=
ituations. And when her time to lead came, she nailed it, reinforcing her _=
**belief**_ that leadership can be trained.

=3D> She now had even _**more belief**_ in her ability to lead and learn, s=
o she takes even more action, learns _**even more**_ about leadership, prac=

The big takeaway here is=E2=80=A6

Have strong _**belief**_ in yourself.

And if you're mouthing '_ughh easier said than done_', do us both a favor a=
nd stop reading. I can't help you if you don't even _believe_ change is pos=
sible.

(Ok ok I=E2=80=99m only joking=E2=80=A6but also not really)

If you want to break out of a negative spiral, you need to be open to the i=
dea that you=E2=80=99re in control of what you believe.=20

And that's where these three strategies come in:

### **=F0=9F=97=83=EF=B8=8F  1. Careful Content Curation**

The easiest way to =E2=80=9Chack=E2=80=9D your beliefs?

**Get inspired. **Change your definition of what=E2=80=99s possible.

For example, I recently read Yia Yiang=E2=80=99s _Rejection Proof_, about h=
ow an initially shy guy took on a 100 day =E2=80=9CRejection Challenge=E2=
=80=9D to overcome his fear of rejection.=C2=A0

(He asked for crazy things like planting a shrub in someone=E2=80=99s garde=
n, asking for donuts in the shape of Olympic rings, and asking for a =E2=80=
=9Cburger refill=E2=80=9D!)

Afterwards?

You _**believe**_ that conquering your fears and building courage is very d=
o-able. (Which in turn gets you to take more action e.g. by doing a 100 day=
 rejection challenge).

_This is why you=E2=80=99ve got to be __**extremely**__ careful about curat=
ing the content you consume._

Inspirational content will change your belief upwards, but =E2=80=9Cblack-p=
ill=E2=80=9D doom-and-gloom content will have your beliefs working against =
you.

(Part of the reason I write Coached is to give you practical ways to improv=
e each part of your career. Once you see these things *can* be improved, yo=
u'll believe it=E2=80=99s possible, take action, get results, which will th=
en reinforce the belief that you can make progress.)

### =F0=9F=A7=A9**  2. Play a game within a game**

Let=E2=80=99s say you just can=E2=80=99t shake your beliefs. You can=E2=80=
=99t get inspired. Then what do you do?

Simple:

Change your =E2=80=9Cactions=E2=80=9D by playing a =E2=80=9Cgame within a g=
ame=E2=80=9D.

For example:

Let=E2=80=99s say you have the (negative) belief that =E2=80=9Cno-one would=
 ever respond to my cold emails.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0

Here=E2=80=99s what you do:=C2=A0

Instead of trying to win the =E2=80=9Cfull game=E2=80=9D (getting a respons=
e from cold emails), you decide to narrow your focus to playing a smaller g=
ame like:

* Writing hilarious cold emails that can=E2=80=99t be ignored

* Sending out 5 cold emails every week, regardless of how people respond.

* Trying to make it about the recipient as much as possible, not you.

Because these small games are easy to act on and win=E2=80=A6 **they=E2=80=
=99ll eventually give you results in the =E2=80=9Cbig game=E2=80=9D **(a co=
ld email response)**, which=E2=80=99ll change your belief.**

Finally=E2=80=A6

### =F0=9F=98=B5=E2=80=8D=F0=9F=92=AB**  3. Don=E2=80=99t be Delusional!**

As you know, I=E2=80=99m a huge fan of LinkedIn content. I think it can rea=
lly help your career, position you as an expert, and open up doors that wou=
ldn=E2=80=99t budge otherwise.

So, people hear this, _believe_ it=E2=80=99s possible, take _action_, and t=
hen=E2=80=A6

Crickets.

And because they didn=E2=80=99t get the _result_ (in this case, an INSTANT =
career boost, this changes their _belief_ to =E2=80=9CLinkedIn is totally a=
 waste of time.=E2=80=9D

But the problem isn=E2=80=99t that LinkedIn doesn=E2=80=99t work.=C2=A0

_**It=E2=80=99s their expectations!**_

I hate to be a meanie, but=E2=80=A6

Believing that posting 10 times total on LinkedIn will transform your caree=
r is=E2=80=A6 well, **delusional**.=20

(Of course you=E2=80=99re not gonna get the =E2=80=9Cresult=E2=80=9D if you=
 think that).=C2=A0

Whereas if you have realistic expectations from the start =E2=80=93 that =
=E2=80=9Cposting consistently for 6 _months, not days_, will boost my caree=
r=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 then you=E2=80=99ll be more patient for a result, get =
it, which=E2=80=99ll then reinforce your =E2=80=9CLinkedIn =3D good=E2=80=
=9D belief.

Today was a very different topic to the usual career strategy, and it took =
me a while to write (sorry that it=E2=80=99s longer than usual!).=20

But I=E2=80=99m curious if it resonated and if you enjoyed reading this. I=
=E2=80=99d say it=E2=80=99s more =E2=80=98mindset=E2=80=99 kind of stuff ra=
ther than careers =E2=80=94=C2=A0it=E2=80=99s what I personally love readin=
g about, and it=E2=80=99s not talked about a lot in the world of career coa=
ching.

And if you did enjoy reading this email=E2=80=A6

(I don=E2=80=99t ask you for a lot=E2=80=A6.rather, these emails are expens=
ive to send out, yet I keep them free and don=E2=80=99t clutter them with a=
ds)

Do me a favor and either:

1. **Tell a friend about these emails**. **[Here=E2=80=99s a link](https://=
link.resumeworded.com/share-the-email)** to share the series so they get th=
e next one, or tell them to go to _[Coached.com](http://Coached.com)__ to s=
ign up._

2. **Engage with me on ****[any of my recent LinkedIn posts](https://www.li=
nkedin.com/in/rohanmahtani/recent-activity/all/)** =E2=80=94=C2=A0if you li=
ke what I write here, you=E2=80=99ll enjoy what I write there too.

3. **[Leave a review](https://resumeworded.com/leave-a-review-newsletter)**=

Stuff like this helps and makes all the efforts feel worth it =E2=80=94=C2=

## How to target your resume to a job

_Read the full article ___[here](https://resumeworded.com/blog/targeted-res=
ume-how-to-tailor-your-resume-to-a-job/)___._

Some people say you should make a new resume for each job you apply to. If =
you had all the time in the world, then, yes, that=E2=80=99s a good idea.=20

But most of us don=E2=80=99t and want to be more efficient. If that=E2=80=
=99s you, do these two things instead:

#### **=E2=9C=B4 If you don=E2=80=99t have a lot of time, edit just your sk=
ills section**

This is the quickest way to target your resume. Look at the job description=
 you apply to, pick out core skills, and update your skills section with th=
e ones you have. This helps you get past the ATS, especially if the recruit=
ers are looking out for any specific skills.

To make this easier, use a tool like _[Targeted Resume](http://resumeworded=
.com/targeted-resume)_ to automatically find which core ATS skills you=E2=
=80=99re missing (based on the job you're applying to).

#### **=E2=9A=A1 Create 3-5 resume versions for the sub-fields you are targ=
eting**

Create one for each 'job type' you are applying for. For example, if you=E2=
=80=99re applying for marketing roles, you might have a resume:

* targeting sales and account management roles, highlighting your experienc=
e speaking to customers

* aimed at branding and design roles, highlighting your creative experience=
 and tools you=E2=80=99ve used like Canva and Photoshop

* targeting more user acquisition or media buying roles=20

=F0=9F=8E=AF By the way, _if you haven't yet used __[Score My Resume](https=
://resumeworded.com/score)__ to get an instant resume review, do that first=
_. The tool will scan your resume for key things hiring managers look for a=
nd tell you where it falls short.=20

(Btw, don=E2=80=99t forget to try out the _Magic Write _feature within the =
tool, which will use AI to rewrite your bullet points and make them a whole=
 lot more impressive to recruiters).

Hey, I'm Rohan. Some people are into yoga, others are into fishing - me, I'=
m all about self-improvement. Years ago, I got fed up with the fluff that p=
asses for career advice out there. So, I started Resume Worded and this ema=
il series, Coached, to share the industry insider info I was learning.

Think of this email as your weekly dose of career coaching you didn't know =
you needed. No fluff, no platitudes, no-BS =E2=80=94 just real stuff that y=
ou need to hear to shape your career into what you want it to be.

Until next time,
