Here=E2=80=99s a piece of career advice that=E2=80=99s stayed with me:

One day, legendary investor and one of the world=E2=80=99s top-10 richest
men, Warren Buffett, is talking to a group of students, when one pipes
up:

=E2=80=9CMr Buffett, how can we be successful like you?=E2=80=9D

Buffett=E2=80=99s reply was fascinating.

=E2=80=9CImagine you=E2=80=99re back in high school,=E2=80=9D he told them,=
 =E2=80=9Cand a
genie grants you one wish:

You can choose anyone in your class, and for the rest of your life,
you=E2=80=99ll get 10% of that person=E2=80=99s income. Who would you choos=
e? Who
would you bet on?

The straight-A student? The captain of the lacrosse team? The kid who
fixes computers in his spare time?

And most important of all=E2=80=A6

Would you bet on yourself?

If not, become the person you=E2=80=99d bet on.=E2=80=9D

It=E2=80=99s a great thought experiment, particularly when it comes to
job-searching.

Day-in, day-out, I hear from hundreds of people who can=E2=80=99t seem to
land an interview, nevermind a job. My question to them is always the
same:

=E2=80=9CReading your resume, _would you hire yourself_?=E2=80=9D

If not, become the person you would hire.

In my own job-hunting days, I did something similar.

After getting brutal feedback from hiring managers, I started studying
the best resumes I could find and comparing them to my own.

Very quickly, one thing became painfully obvious:

=E2=80=9C_I wouldn=E2=80=99t hire me over these guys_=E2=80=A6 _even if I o=
ffered to
work for free_=E2=80=9D

Very embarrassing..

But it did make punching up my resume very easy - all I had to do was
style it on the resumes I=E2=80=99d =E2=80=98bet=E2=80=99 on.

That=E2=80=99s why with Resume Worded Pro, you=E2=80=99ll get access to 500=
+
sample resume bullets, written by real hiring managers and taken from
some of the best resumes I=E2=80=99ve ever seen, which you can tweak and us=
e
for your own.

For most people, reading them is a huge =E2=80=9Cah-ha=E2=80=9D moment.

_So that=E2=80=99s what a great resume bullet looks like!_

And from there, it=E2=80=99s pretty simple to turn your resume from tired t=
o
inspired.
