Hey, GitLab community! March=E2=80=99s Monday Merge is here, and this month=
 is packed with major updates. We=E2=80=99re unveiling the private beta of =
GitLab Duo Workflow, bringing agentic AI to DevSecOps, and GitLab Duo Self-=
Hosted, giving enterprises complete control over AI capabilities. Plus, Git=
Lab 17.9 has over 110 improvements! Let=E2=80=99s dive in. =F0=9F=9A=80 Git=
Lab Duo Workflow: Agentic AI built on the most comprehensive DevSecOps plat=
form We're excited to announce the opening of the waitlist for the private =
beta of GitLab Duo Workflow. This next step in our AI roadmap will help dev=
elopment teams navigate everything from project bootstrapping to deployment=
 processes, from debugging issues to cross-team coordination, all within th=
e IDE. =F0=9F=92=A1 What makes GitLab Duo Workflow different? GitLab Duo Wo=
rkflow leverages the GitLab platform's structure for collaboration, continu=
ous integration, continuous deployment, security, and compliance to help or=
ganizations accelerate their development process with AI agents.=C2=A0 Use =
GitLab Duo Workflow to help you: =F0=9F=9A=80 Bootstrap a new development p=
roject - Automate project bootstrapping directly in the IDE, providing the =
right configurations from the start so you can focus on innovation sooner. =
=F0=9F=94=84 Modernize code - Help modernize your codebase by handling code=
 refactoring =E2=80=93 from code to tests, including understanding dependen=
cies, tests, CI/CD pipelines, and documentation. =E2=9A=A1 Perform contextu=
al tasks - Help resolve tasks with the full context of your codebase-relate=
d issues and merge requests, letting developers stay in their flow. =F0=9F=
=93=9D Create documentation - Support developers in generating and updating=
 documentation, including README files, code flow diagrams, and architectur=
e documentation. =F0=9F=A7=AA Enhance test coverage - Generate tests for en=
tire sections of your codebase while integrating with your existing test in=
frastructure, ensuring more reliable software with less effort. =E2=9C=A8 A=
nd more - This is just the beginning! With GitLab=E2=80=99s unified data st=
ore, the more you use GitLab, the more context GitLab Duo Workflow has abou=
t your code, configurations, security findings, and deployment practices. T=
he result: an increasingly powerful development experience that's tailored =
to your organization. The GitLab DevSecOps platform combined with GitLab AI=
 agents brings everything together in a single data model that encapsulates=
 source code, merge requests, epics, users, access rights, and more. The ag=
ents we're building use context about users and projects to standardize how=
 teams work and automate the non-coding tasks that absorb developer time, s=
uch as scanning for security issues and enforcing compliance rules. When AI=
 is built directly into the platform, these capabilities become even more p=
owerful, turning AI agents into development partners while keeping you in c=
ontrol of how AI enhances the process. This isn't a far-off future =E2=80=
=94 it's what we're building right now with GitLab Duo Workflow. =F0=9F=93=
=A2 Sign up for the private beta waitlist! =F0=9F=9B=A1=EF=B8=8F GitLab Duo=
 Self-Hosted: Enterprise AI built for data privacy We are excited to announ=
ce the general availability of GitLab Duo Self-Hosted for Code Suggestions =
and Chat. GitLab Duo Self-Hosted supports deployment flexibility across mul=
tiple platforms, including on-premise infrastructure or in private clouds a=
nd secure cloud environments through AWS Bedrock and Azure OpenAI. =F0=9F=
=94=90 Why GitLab Duo Self-Hosted? Security concerns have been a major barr=
ier to AI adoption in regulated industries. In our Global DevSecOps Survey,=
 more than half of the respondents said that introducing AI into the softwa=
re development lifecycle is risky. GitLab Duo Self-Hosted expands the avail=
ability of GitLab Duo AI features to organizations with stringent data priv=
acy requirements, offering flexibility in both AI large language model (LLM=
) selection and deployment options. The earliest adopters include organizat=
ions in the public sector and regulated industries =E2=80=93 e.g., financia=
l services, automotive, and healthcare. These organizations seek to gain th=
e competitive advantage of AI by integrating AI-powered development tools i=
nto their environments, while also giving security teams the control they n=
eed. =F0=9F=96=A5=EF=B8=8F Now supporting: =E2=9C=85 On-premises - Mistral =
models with the vLLM serving platform =E2=9C=85 AWS - Mistral and Anthropic=
 Claude 3.5 Sonnet via AWS Bedrock =E2=9C=85 Microsoft Azure - OpenAI GPT m=
odels via Azure AI =F0=9F=93=A2 How does this impact enterprise teams? By i=
solating your GitLab instance, AI gateway, and LLMs in your own environment=
 or country of choice, GitLab Duo Self-Hosted makes it possible for sensiti=
ve data and intellectual property to remain within your designated perimete=
r. Granular control over data locality helps enable adherence to strict dat=
a residency regulations, while adopting AI capabilities in secure settings.=
 Whether you use GitLab Duo Self-Hosted in a completely air-gapped environm=
ent with vLLM or leverage a supported private cloud, you can control all as=
pects of the deployment to include the geographic location of components. B=
y eliminating the reliance on external APIs and providing full visibility i=
nto all request and response logs, GitLab Duo Self-Hosted helps even the mo=
st regulated organizations confidently adopt AI capabilities and meet the m=
ost stringent compliance obligations. One U.S. government agency says: "Aft=
er selecting GitLab as the cornerstone of our agency-wide DevSecOps platfor=
m, we chose GitLab Duo Self-Hosted to further advance our software factory =
capabilities. GitLab Duo's ability to operate in air-gapped environments an=
d provide granular control over our data was crucial to delivering secure A=
I-powered features." =F0=9F=94=8E Learn more=C2=A0about GitLab Duo Self-Hos=

=E2=80=99s end-to-end DevSecOps platform, MIS has achieved remarkable effic=
