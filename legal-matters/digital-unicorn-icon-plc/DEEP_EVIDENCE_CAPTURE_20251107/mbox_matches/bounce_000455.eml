Getting a data engineering job is complicated. After the crowd of people sc=
reaming =E2=80=9CLEARN PYTHON AND SQL,=E2=80=9D you=E2=80=99ll still find y=
ourself lost in a sea of technologies like Spark, Flink, Iceberg, BigQuery,=
 and now even AI-driven platforms.
Knowing where to start and how to get a handle on this requires some guidan=
ce. This newsletter is going to unveil the steps needed to break into data =
engineering in 2025 and how AI fits into the picture.
DataExpert.io Newsletter is a reader-supported publication. To receive new =
posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.
A lot of people still think that after you=E2=80=99ve done a magical number=
 of Leetcode problems, a job falls into your lap. That=E2=80=99s almost nev=
er the case!
To get a job in 2025, you=E2=80=99ll need the following things:
Demonstrable skills with:
SQL and Python
Distributed compute (Snowflake, Spark, BigQuery, DuckDB)
Orchestration knowledge (Airflow, Mage, or Databricks workflows)
Data modeling and data quality
AI/data integrations (vector databases, embeddings, RAG pipelines)
An opportunity to demonstrate those skills via a portfolio project
A personal brand that radiates above the noise both on LinkedIn and in inte=
rviews
Let=E2=80=99s dig into each of these areas and see how you can fast-track y=
our way to success!

nzbR7ItMXV1fLOwIjU_0GR6EVSHuA ] designed for data engineers who want to mas=
ter the basics and build amazing data products.
Learning SQL
Avoiding SQL is the same as avoiding a job in data engineering. This is the=
 most fundamental language you need to know.
There are many resources out there to learn it! The ones I recommend are:
DataExpert.io free SQL question practice [ https://substack.com/redirect/68=
05660c-dc67-4e0e-99ad-50148380e97e?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn0.Xt_QeDUo-XU_b4nz=

 ]
Key things you should know in this bucket are:
The basics
JOINs
INNER, LEFT, FULL OUTER
Remember you should almost never use RIGHT JOIN
Aggregations with GROUP BY
Know the differences between COUNT and COUNT(DISTINCT)
Remember that COUNT(DISTINCT) is much slower in distributed environments li=
ke Spark
Know how to use aggregation functions with CASE WHEN statements
example: COUNT(CASE WHEN status =3D =E2=80=98expired=E2=80=99 THEN order_id=
 END) this counts the number of expired orders
Know about cardinality reduction and bucketing your dimensions
example:
SELECT CASE WHEN age > 30 THEN =E2=80=98old=E2=80=99 ELSE =E2=80=98young=E2=
=80=99 END as age_bucket, COUNT(1) FROM users GROUP BY 1
You=E2=80=99ll see in this query, we take a high cardinality dimension like=
 age and make it a lower cardinality (just two values =E2=80=9Cold=E2=80=9D=
 and =E2=80=9Cyoung=E2=80=9D)
Common Table Expressions vs Subquery vs View vs Temp Table (a great YouTube=
 video here [ https://substack.com/redirect/71fc5892-1e5b-419c-a1d9-44a5d41=
92c5a?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn0.Xt_QeDUo-XU_b4nzbR7ItMXV1fLOwIjU_0GR6EVSHuA ]=
)
The key things here are:
You should very rarely be using subquery (it hurts readability of pipelines=
)
You should use temp table if you need to reuse some logic since Temp Table =
gets materialized and will improve the performance of your pipeline
You should use View when you need to store logic for longer than the durati=
on of the pipeline execution
In all other cases, you should use common table expressions to improve read=
ability!
Understand how SQL works in distributed environments
Know what keywords trigger shuffle
JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
Know what keywords are extremely scalable (this means they=E2=80=99re execu=
ted entirely on the map-side)
SELECT, FROM, WHERE, LIMIT
Know window functions thoroughly (great YouTube video here [ https://substa=
ck.com/redirect/9fd4821c-2899-47e0-bace-57348f5b2f5a?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn=
0.Xt_QeDUo-XU_b4nzbR7ItMXV1fLOwIjU_0GR6EVSHuA ])
The basics
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY <partition> ORDER BY <order by> ROWS BETWEEN <pre=
ceding> PRECEDING AND <following rows>)
You have the function (e.g. RANK, SUM, etc).
You have PARTITION BY this divides the window up. Maybe you want to do wind=
ow functions per department or country?
You have ORDER BY this determines the sorting of the window
You have the ROWS BETWEEN clause to determine how many rows you should incl=
ude in your window. If you don=E2=80=99t specify this, it defaults to ROWS =
BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW. So the default is the =E2=80=
=9Ccumulative=E2=80=9D row definition.
Understand RANK vs DENSE_RANK vs ROW_NUMBER(a quick two minute YouTube vide=
o about this) [ https://substack.com/redirect/8d177991-838a-4deb-b90a-02506=
9480efd?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn0.Xt_QeDUo-XU_b4nzbR7ItMXV1fLOwIjU_0GR6EVSHuA=
 ]
Key things:
When there is no tie in your ORDER BY clause, these functions are identical
When there are ties,
RANK skips values (e.g. a tie for 1st place means the next place is third)
DENSE_RANK does not skip values (e.g. a tie for 1st place means the next pl=
ace is second)
ROW_NUMBER guarantees unique values with no ties (a tie for first place mea=
ns one of them will get second place, this is based on the natural ordering=
 of the data)
Understand how to do =E2=80=9Crolling=E2=80=9D calculations
Rolling average and sum by department is a common interview question. You c=
an solve it with a query like this:
SELECT revenue_date, SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY re=
venue_date ROWS BETWEEN 30 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as thirty_day_rolling=
_revenue FROM daily_sales
You=E2=80=99ll see we split the window by department, then we look at the r=
olling 30 day period for each day and sum it up. You need to be careful her=
e and ensure that there is data (even if it=E2=80=99s zero) for each date o=
therwise you=E2=80=99ll calculations will be wrong!
Know about the differences between INSERT INTO, INSERT OVERWRITE and MERGE
INSERT INTO just copies the data from the result query into the table. THIS=
 IS PRONE TO DUPLICATES! If you=E2=80=99re using INSERT INTO, it should alw=
ays be coupled with either TRUNCATE or a DELETE statement!
INSERT OVERWRITE is nice because it copies the data and replaces whatever e=
xisting data is in that partition. This is the most common one they use in =
big tech!
MERGE is nice because it looks at the existing data and copies only the row=
s that are updated and/or deletes the rows that aren=E2=80=99t in the incom=
ing data. The only minus of MERGE is the comparisons it needs to do to acco=
mplish this can be very slow for large data sets!
What=E2=80=99s new in 2025?
AI copilots like Databricks Genie and Snowflake Cortex will happily write S=
QL for you. But interviewers now test whether you can verify, debug, and op=
timize AI-generated SQL.
Understanding how SQL runs in distributed environments (shuffle, partitioni=
ng, scalability) is still your edge over someone blindly trusting a copilot=
=2E
Learning Python (and AI Integration)
SQL is great and can accomplish a lot in data engineering. There are limita=
tions to it though. To overcome these limitations you need a more complete =
language like Python.
Here are the concepts you need to learn:
Data types and data structures
Basics
strings, integers, decimals, booleans
complex
lists (or arrays), dictionaries, stacks and queues
Other data structures you probably don=E2=80=99t need to learn (although th=
ese might show up in interviews which sucks!)
heaps, trees, graphs, self-balancing trees, tries
Algorithms
Basics
Loops, linear search, binary search
Big O Notation
You should be able to write down both the space and time complexity of algo=
rithms [ https://substack.com/redirect/0d22136c-28ed-4240-87ff-deb436a4f9f1=
?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn0.Xt_QeDUo-XU_b4nzbR7ItMXV1fLOwIjU_0GR6EVSHuA ]
Algorithms you probably don=E2=80=99t need to know (although these might sh=
ow up in interviews which sucks!)
Dijkstra's algorithm, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms
Using Python as an orchestrator
One of the most common use cases for Python in data engineering is to const=
ruct Airflow DAGs
Using Python to interact with REST APIs
A common data source for data engineers is REST data. Learn about GET, POST=
, PUT request in Python. The requests [ https://substack.com/redirect/3b216=
11f-ef2f-4a33-b7f7-85adaf08a47b?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn0.Xt_QeDUo-XU_b4nzbR7=
ItMXV1fLOwIjU_0GR6EVSHuA ] package in Python is great for this!
Know how to test your code with pytest (in Python) or JUnit (in Scala)
There=E2=80=99s a really solid library called Chispa [ https://substack.com=
/redirect/e8cb8fa6-17f7-4100-9ce1-0dbb3cabbdb0?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn0.Xt_Q=
eDUo-XU_b4nzbR7ItMXV1fLOwIjU_0GR6EVSHuA ] that works well with pytest for t=
esting your PySpark jobs you should check out!
New in 2025:
Python is now the glue between data engineering and AI. You=E2=80=99ll need=
 to know:
Calling LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source models)
Generating and storing embeddings
Working with vector databases (Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate, pgvector)
Building lightweight RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines
Writing =E2=80=9CAI validators=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 Python jobs that use an L=
LM to check data quality or generate documentation
Learning Distributed Compute (either Spark, BigQuery or Snowflake)
Back in the late 2000s, Hadoop was born and so was the notion of distribute=
d compute. This means that instead of having one fancy computer process all=
 your data you have a team of computers each process a small chunk!
This concept unlocks the possibility of computing vast amounts of data in a=
 small amount of time by leveraging teamwork! But this does not come withou=
t complexity!
Here are some things to consider:
Shuffle
If we are using teamwork, we need to guarantee certain data is on a certain=
 machine (like if we are counting how many messages each user has received)=
=2E The team accomplishes this guarante=
e by passing all of your data to one m=
achine via shuffle (example in the diagram below). We only HAVE to do this =
when we do GROUP BY, JOIN, or ORDER BY. (a quick 2 minute video about how I=
 managed this at petabyte scale at Netflix [ https://substack.com/redirect/=
df38881f-8cf1-418f-a5ea-42db2904a015?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn0.Xt_QeDUo-XU_b4=
nzbR7ItMXV1fLOwIjU_0GR6EVSHuA ])
Shuffling isn=E2=80=99t a bad thing remember! It actually is really good be=
cause it makes distributed compute mostly the same as single node compute! =
The only time it gets in the way of things is at very large scale!
Things you should consider to reduce shuffling at very large scale
Broadcast JOIN
If one side of your JOIN is small (< 5 GBs), you can =E2=80=9Cbroadcast=E2=
=80=9D the entire data set to your executors. This allows you to do the joi=
n without shuffle which is much faster
Bucket JOIN
If both sides of your JOIN are large, you can bucket them first and then do=
 the join, this allows. Remember you=E2=80=99ll still have to shuffle the d=
ata once to bucket it, but if you=E2=80=99re doing multiple JOIN with this =
data set it will be worth it!
Partitioning your data set
Sometimes you=E2=80=99re just trying to JOIN too much data because you shou=
ld JOIN one day of data not multiple. Think about how you could do your JOI=

Data Modeling and Data Quality
Data engineering is ultimately about delivering usable, correct, privacy-co=
mpliant data.
Here are the ways you can assess data quality:
Data should be correct
You should check for duplicates, NULLs, proper formatting. Also checking th=
at there is the right number of rows in the data set!
Data should be usable and efficient
This means it should have proper documentation and good column names. The q=
uery patterns should also allow for fast answers to questions! Answers shou=
ldn=E2=80=99t give Jeff Bezos millions of dollars either!
Data should be privacy-compliant
An often overlooked part of the puzzle. You shouldn=E2=80=99t be hurting us=
er privacy to make your analytics better!
So how do you achieve this output data set nirvana dream? It has multiple p=
arts!
Correctness should be handled in a few ways
The first pass should be via validation from a data analyst. This a part of=
 the powerful MIDAS process [ https://substack.com/redirect/a6473b9d-2c70-4=
8c8-8e30-ae7b418652b3?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn0.Xt_QeDUo-XU_b4nzbR7ItMXV1fLOw=
IjU_0GR6EVSHuA ] at Airbnb that you should check out!
After that, you should build in automated data quality checks into your pip=
eline with something like Great Expectations [ https://substack.com/redirec=
t/6697366f-928e-41cd-9492-23b81151818a?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn0.Xt_QeDUo-XU_=
b4nzbR7ItMXV1fLOwIjU_0GR6EVSHuA ]. Remember to follow the write-audit-publi=
sh pattern [ https://substack.com/redirect/c96283e1-51ff-450b-8280-70ce5040=
1902?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNmJqN2cyIn0.Xt_QeDUo-XU_b4nzbR7ItMXV1fLOwIjU_0GR6EVSHuA ] =
here so you don=E2=80=99t publish bad data into production that doesn=E2=80=
=99t pass data quality checks!
Usability and efficiency are handled with a few things
Documentation should be a big part of the process. Spec building and stakeh=
older sign-off should happen BEFORE you start building your pipeline. This =
will prevent a lot of redoing and undoing of work!
Leveraging efficient practices for your data lake:
Manage your Apache Iceberg snapshots for time-traveling and disaster recove=
ry
Set good retention policies on your data so you don=E2=80=99t have a huge c=
loud bill for data you do not use!
Data modeling is going to be the other big piece of this puzzle
There are a few camps here:
Relational data modeling
This type prioritizes data deduplication at the cost of more complex querie=
s. Think of this as prioritizing storage at the cost of compute.
Dimensional (or Kimball) data modeling
This denormalizes the data into facts and dimensions which prioritizes larg=
er queries but duplicates data a bit. Think of this as trying to balance th=
e costs of storage and compute.
One Big Table
This denormalizes the data even more where the facts and dimensions are in =
one table. You duplicate data more but you get extremely efficient queries =
from it. Think of this as prioritizing compute at the cost of storage.
I wrote a long-form article detailing the differences and when to pick whic=
h one here [ https://substack.com/redirect/aed6c81f-d796-42ab-a01e-4de99869=

Privacy compliant data sets
Be mindful where you have personally identifiable information in your data =
sets and don=E2=80=99t hold onto that longer than you need.
Remember that anything that can bring you back to a user is personally iden=
tifiable!
Anonymizing the data [ https://substack.com/redirect/edb5ded5-d722-4d1a-884=

user privacy and long-term analytical capabilities
New in 2025:
AI-assisted quality checks. Tools now let you point LLMs at logs or query r=
esults to spot anomalies.
Semantic modeling. Using embeddings to cluster or enrich tables with =E2=80=
=9Csemantic meaning.=E2=80=9D
Privacy in AI. You must ensure embeddings don=E2=80=99t leak personally ide=
ntifiable information. Vector search can accidentally memorize sensitive da=
ta if you=E2=80=99re careless.
Building a Portfolio Project
This is where you separate yourself from the pack.
You should pick a project that:
You care about deeply. I was obsessed about Magic the Gathering and that wa=
s what allowed me to keep working on that project even though I wasn=E2=80=
=99t getting paid
You can work on it for 3 months at 5-10 hours per week. A portfolio piece s=
houldn=E2=80=99t be easy to create. If it was easy to create, everybody wou=
ld do it and then you wouldn=E2=80=99t stand out!
You build a piece that has a frontend! Another portfolio piece I build was =

 Without a frontend, your data pipelines are a little bit harder to show of=
f. This is why learning a skill like Tableau or Power BI can be a really so=
lid way to make your portfolio shine even if those aren=E2=80=99t skills yo=
u end up using on the job!
You implement the following things in your portfolio
A comprehensive documentation that details all the inputs and output data s=
ets, the data quality checks, how often the pipeline runs, etc.
You have a pipeline running in production. Using something like Databricks =
Free Edition would be a great place to get started!
You leverage hot technologies like Spark, Snowflake, Vector Databases, Iceb=
erg, and/or Delta Lake.
If you want to stand out, you build a JavaScript front end like I did with =
HaloGods and you=E2=80=99ll find yourself landing jobs in big tech even tho=
ugh you didn=E2=80=99t go to Stanford, MIT or IIT.

Here are some things you should do to get there:
Build relationships on LinkedIn
You should be building relationships with
Hiring managers and recruiters
Peers
You should start talking with people BEFORE you ask for a referral and star=
t building up friendships and your network.=20
If you need a referral, it would be better to send out DMs to people and as=
k them what the job is like. Leading with questions instead of tasks will h=
ave a much higher hit rate!=20
Also remember that this DM game is a low percentage play. If you send out 2=
0 DMs, 1 or 2 might respond, especially if you=E2=80=99re early in your car=
eer. Finding creators and employees that are near your same level will help=
 increase that hit rate!

Interview like a person, not a robot
When you go into the interview make sure you have:
Researched the people who are interviewing you. You should know

What they do for the company
Asked the recruiter a lot of detailed questions about the role
What technologies will I be using
How many people will be on my team
