----------## How to get over failure and setbacks

The date is April 26th, 2003=E2=80=A6

And a young guy called Aron is hiking in Blue John Canyon, Utah. He grabs o=
nto what he thinks is a stable boulder to cross a gap in the rockface.

**Big mistake**.

The boulder dislodges, causing Aron to plummet to the canyon below, with th=
e boulder landing on top of his arm, trapping him.

He's stuck, with no phone, and no one knows he's there.

Over the next 4 days, Aron tries everything to get out, but nothing works.

That's when it dawns on him=E2=80=A6

**This might be the end. **And he screams and cries in regret.

Aron's story is extreme, but it got me thinking about the mistakes we make =
in our careers.

Cos sooner or later, we all make them. Sometimes big ones that change the c=
ourse of our lives. Maybe we take a job that's a bad fit. Or someone else g=
ets promoted instead of us. Or we get fired.

But=E2=80=A6how do we deal with it?

Here are a few of my thoughts:

----------
**=E2=80=A6by the way, if you use LinkedIn, **_**[go to my profile](https:/=
/www.linkedin.com/in/rohanmahtani/)**_** and hit the =E2=80=98Follow=E2=80=
=99 button**. I share a mix of practical career strategy and mid-week motiv=
ation =E2=80=94=C2=A0stuff that makes it easy to keep your career on track.

_**Topics coming up this week**_: how to make a great first impression, con=
fidence hacks for introverts + more. _[See you there](https://www.linkedin.=
com/comm/mynetwork/discovery-see-all?usecase=3DPEOPLE_FOLLOWS&followMember=
=3Drohanmahtani)_.

alright, let=E2=80=99s get back to my essay=E2=80=A6


----------### =F0=9F=AA=A8**  **_**=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s been waiting for m=
e=E2=80=9D**_

Let's get back to Aron. After almost 5 days, he's cursing the rock.

"I HATE THIS ROCK!!!!" he shouts, pounding his free arm off it.

Stuck, he hallucinates and thinks about all the mistakes he's made. How he =
didn't spend time with family, or ruined personal relationships, and was to=
o proud to be anything but a "lone wolf"...

=E2=80=A6 which got him into this mess.

And that's when he has an epiphany:

_"It's funny how things come together=E2=80=A6 It's me. I chose this. I cho=
se all of this._ **_This rock's been waiting for me my entire life=E2=80=A6=
_** _ever since it was a bit of meteorite a billion years ago in space. It'=
s been waiting, to come here. Right, right here._

_I've been moving towards it my entire life. The minute I was born, every b=
reath that I've taken, every action has been leading me to this crack on th=
e Earth's surface."_

As soon as Aron realizes the rock was =E2=80=9Cmeant=E2=80=9D for him=E2=80=
=A6

He finds a (rather grisly) way out! (Watch 127 Hours if you wanna know more=
).

My point?=C2=A0

**What if ****your setback**** was just like Aron=E2=80=99s rock**? And it=
=E2=80=99s been waiting for you your entire life to teach you something?

What if, instead of a curse=E2=80=A6

### =F0=9F=8E=81**  **_**=E2=80=A6 it=E2=80=99s a gift?**_

Say you lose your job. You=E2=80=99ve been there for four years, you=E2=80=
=99ve had a comfy salary, and you=E2=80=99re understandably upset.

Maybe the economy sucked and your employer let you go. Or you f'd up and we=
re let go.

It's normal to be totally upset. But imagine if you reframed it:

_"I've been stuck at the same job for the last 4 years. If I was here for a=
nother 5 years, would I have been fulfilled? =E2=80=A6Probably not. Maybe t=
his was the push I needed."_

I love this perspective.

### **=E2=8F=B3 **_**Every setback has a lesson. How fast can you find it?*=
*_

Setbacks suck. But they're inevitable.

And each one comes with a lesson. A clue for how to do better next time.

Some people miss this. They replay stuff in their head forever, blame thems=
elves, and never look for the learning.

Maybe bombing that client pitch taught you the importance of preparation. M=
aybe missing that project deadline showed you need a better way to manage y=
our time.

The takeaway: _Aim to cut down the time between a mistake happening and fin=
ding the lesson in it_.=20

### =F0=9F=92=A1_** How to find the lessons faster**_

I know what I've said is easier said than done. When we make mistakes, our =
emotions often take over. If someone asked me, "_What's the lesson here_?" =
right after I screwed-up, I'd probably block their number!

But here's a two-step process that can help:

First, recognize that both rational and emotional sides to our brain. we ha=
ve When things go wrong, emotions take the wheel. That's normal. But to fin=
d the lesson, we need to engage our rational side.=20

One trick is to ask yourself, "__If this happened to a friend, what would I=
 tell them?__" It helps you remove yourself from the situation.

Think about it: when a friend asks for advice, you're objective. They might=
 say, "I messed up at work. Am I going to get fired? What do I do?".=20

Because you're not emotionally involved, you can give clear-headed guidance=
 =E2=80=94 while your friend=E2=80=99s emotionally involved and can=E2=80=
=99t.

So, next time you're in the thick of a setback, step back and imagine you'r=
e advising a friend. What would you tell them? How would you help them see =
the situation objectively?

It's funny how much easier it is to think clearly when we step outside of o=
urselves.=20

That=E2=80=99s a wrap for today. I hope this is an email you can come back =
to when you=E2=80=99re facing a hard moment and need a small boost or a dif=
ferent perspective.=20

These emails aren=E2=80=99t easy to write each week and cost a lot in email=
 sending costs. But I keep the whole thing free, without sleazy =E2=80=98pa=
y to read the rest of it!=E2=80=99 type of stuff. So in return, **here=E2=
=80=99s the =E2=80=98fee=E2=80=99**:

If an email changes the way you think, opens your mind to a new perspective=
, or gives you an insight you get value from, do one of these:

1. Tell a friend about these emails. **[Here=E2=80=99s a link](https://link=
.resumeworded.com/share-the-email)** to share the series so they get the ne=
xt one, or tell them to go to **_[Coached.com](http://Coached.com)_**_ to s=
ign up._

2. Engage with me on **[any of my recent LinkedIn posts](https://www.linked=
in.com/in/rohanmahtani/recent-activity/all/)** =E2=80=94=C2=A0if you like w=
hat I write here, you=E2=80=99ll enjoy that too.

3. **[Leave a review](https://resumeworded.com/leave-a-review-newsletter)**=
 for Coached.

Stuff like this helps and makes all the efforts feel worth it =E2=80=94=C2=
=A0thank you.=20

## How to show leadership skills on your resume

_Read the full article __[here](https://resumeworded.com/blog/leadership-sk=
ills-on-resume/)__._

=F0=9F=A7=90 =C2=A0Especially if you=E2=80=99re applying for mid- to senior=
-level roles or ones that involve managing others, hiring managers will wan=
t to see evidence of leadership or management skills on your resume.

=E2=9D=8C =C2=A0You can't just say things like "_I have strong management a=
nd leadership skills_" and expect hiring managers to believe you =E2=80=94 =
=C2=A0using subjective buzzwords on your resume is a common mistake people =
make.

=E2=9C=85 =C2=A0Instead, you want to _show evidence_ of leadership through =
your experience =E2=80=94 for example, you might write about when you led a=
n important project or trained others in your team:

* _Trained and mentored 10+ new and existing account executives and interns=
 on solutions selling strategies, customer relationship management, and adv=
anced product knowledge._

=F0=9F=8E=AF =C2=A0**You should use a tool like **[**Score My Resume**](htt=
ps://resumeworded.com/resume-scanner) **to find out if your resume shows en=
ough leadership experience**. One of the components of your resume's score =
is leadership (among 20+ other recruiter checks), so it's a great litmus te=
st to see if you've checked this box. [Try it](http://resumeworded.com/free=
-resume-review).

----------## If you=E2=80=99re new here, hi!

Hey, I'm Rohan. Some people are into yoga, others are into fishing - me, I'=
m all about self-improvement. Years ago, I got fed up with the fluff that p=
asses for career advice out there. So, I started Resume Worded and this ema=
il series, Coached, to share the industry insider info I was learning.

Think of this email as your weekly dose of career coaching you didn't know =
you needed. No fluff, no platitudes, no-BS =E2=80=94=C2=A0just real stuff t=
hat you need to hear to shape your career into what you want it to be.

Until next time,
