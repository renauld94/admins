In case you missed=C2=A0our previous issues and are curious what this is, t=
he idea is simple:=C2=A0We interview seasoned data leaders to learn how the=
y built, scaled,=C2=A0and designed=C2=A0effective data teams. Our guest for=
 this episode=C2=A0is Michael Perlis, the=C2=A0Director of Business Intelli=
gence at ZoomInfo. With over 35,000+ customers worldwide, ZoomInfo is the l=
eading=C2=A0data intelligent platform that helps businesses find, engage, a=
nd win customers ahead of their competitors. Our staff writer, Gabriel Y. W=
. Zhang, conducted and synthesized the interview. Some key learning points =
The ZoomInfo=C2=A0analytics organization follows a hub and spoke model, wit=
h one central analytics organization, and several embedded analytics organi=
zations. Within the org, product analytics is the largest. It is separated =
into two sub-teams, with each focused on a different suite of products. It =
ultimately reports to the Chief Product Officer, to ensure a closer alignme=
nt between product analytics and product decision-making at the highest lev=
el. The two sub-teams follow a standardized process with regards to their c=
ollaboration and communication processes with stakeholders. While they=E2=
=80=99re geographically distributed across Israel and the US, Michael has d=
eliberately restructured both sub-teams to contain a mix of people from bot=
h regions to encourage cross-regional collaboration. He believes that diver=
sity within teams is a force for creativity and innovation. Michael relies =
on a mix of strategies to track the performance of the organization effecti=
vely. Product analytics at ZoomInfo Gabriel Zhang: I feel like ZoomInfo is =
simultaneously well-known yet mysterious. Because while it=E2=80=99s common=
 to see ZoomInfo pages in Google Search results, we rarely hear about the c=
ompany in tech news, even though it=E2=80=99s a large and successful tech o=
rganization. In other words, I=E2=80=99m excited to peel back the curtains =
on ZoomInfo. Can you give me an overview of the analytics function at ZoomI=
nfo? Michael Perlis:=C2=A0Sure thing! I=E2=80=99d say that the analytics fu=
nction at ZoomInfo follows a hub and spoke model, in that we have a central=
 analytics team that sits within engineering, called Enterprise Data and An=
alytics, which oversees areas such as data infrastructure, data governance,=
 data engineering and centralized data products. Outside of this, there are=
 analytics teams embedded within different departments; marketing, go-to-ma=
rket, finance, etc. all have their own analysts. My organization - product =
analytics - is the largest amongst these. Currently, we=E2=80=99ve got 12 p=
eople split into two sub-teams, with each sub-team led by managers. How are=
 the sub-teams differentiated? So, ZoomInfo has a suite of products, and ou=
r product analytics teams are structured to correspond to them. The first s=
ub-team is dedicated to ZoomInfo Sales, our flagship product and largest of=
fering. The second sub-team oversees a few smaller but no less important pr=
oducts: 1) ZoomInfo Marketing, our marketing product, 2) Workflows, which a=
utomates the jobs and processes that sellers would need to do within our pl=
atform, and 3) ZoomInfo Lite, which is our freemium version of ZoomInfo Sal=
es, mainly used by small businesses. This sub-team also looks at product-le=
d growth metrics. =E2=80=9CWhereas if we sat under the CTO, I think we=E2=
=80=99d have felt more disconnected to the details of our product strategy.=
=E2=80=9D One thing that wasn't clear to me is which function product analy=
tics falls under. Also, does it ultimately report to the CTO or to someone =
else? We sit within product, and we ultimately report to the Chief Product =
Officer. Ah, that=E2=80=99s interesting. Most of the analytics organization=
s I=E2=80=99ve seen ultimately report to the CTO or the CFO. Do you think i=
t matters which executive oversees an analytics organization? That=E2=80=99=
s a good question. I=E2=80=99ll take a step back and start by saying that I=
 think it depends on the size of the company. In a really large corporation=
, I think it=E2=80=99d make sense to have the analytics function sit under =
the CTO, because a federated network of analytics orgs can easily get siloe=
d and fragmented. Obviously, size is relative, but because I=E2=80=99ve wor=
ked in companies as big as Deloitte (200,000 people), ZoomInfo (3,000 peopl=
e) feels contextually small to me. But I feel that it=E2=80=99s a really go=
od thing for us to report directly to the CPO. Historically, we had a diffe=
rent environment that was very much anchored by a feature-first mentality, =
where we tried to ship features out of the door as soon as possible to get =
adoption and demonstrate that our product was great. But at the size that t=
he company has grown, we need to take a more data-driven approach with our =
product launches and shift our mindset to an outcome-first approach. What a=
re the experiences that we want for our customers, and what product changes=
 do we need to make to realize them? With our current setup, I=E2=80=99m pa=
rt of the product staff meetings, and I=E2=80=99m very much involved in pro=
duct strategy conversations. This proximity is important, as it informs how=
 I steer the product analytics teams, and how I translate strategy into pro=
duct metrics. Whereas if we sat under the CTO, I think we=E2=80=99d have fe=
lt more disconnected from the details of our product strategy. =C2=A0 Analy=
tics as a Strategic Partner Among the traditional analytics orgs, product a=
nalytics is the one that probably has the most interaction with other orgs.=
 Can you tell me a little about how product analytics at ZoomInfo collabora=
tes with other teams? It=E2=80=99s interesting that you brought this up, be=
cause one of the things we=E2=80=99ve been trying to improve on consciously=
 over the past year, is consistency in terms of how we work with product. A=
t the time I took up this role (in early 2023), the various product analyti=
cs teams had quite a bit of leeway in terms of how they interacted with the=
ir stakeholders. We=E2=80=99ve since consolidated a standardized sprint pla=
n, whereby everyone works in the same cadence. We now have the same process=
 in which we take in requests from stakeholders, and meet with the relevant=
 directors to discuss task prioritization, and all of these have to be comp=
leted by day X and Y respectively within a sprint. And then, within a set p=
eriod of time, we=E2=80=99ll return to them with proposed actions based on =
our interpretation of the deliverables. Because we=E2=80=99re now planning =
our sprints in a much more structured way, we=E2=80=99re able to plan ahead=
. By the time the next quarter starts, we=E2=80=99d have known what=E2=80=
=99s on the product roadmap. And then my managers and I will make sure that=
 we=E2=80=99ll build the data assets, analysis, and dashboards that will be=
 needed in the next three to six months to support the product teams=E2=80=
=99 visions. It also gives us time to sit down with data product managers t=
o build out the necessary taxonomy, and sketch out the tracking events requ=
ired for certain product metrics. The data product managers, in turn, will =
go to engineering to discuss the instrumentation of these events. That said=
, I=E2=80=99m trying to reshape the product analytics organization so that =
it functions more like a strategic analytics partner to the business in the=
 future, as opposed to its current mode, which is still mostly execution-fo=
cused. =E2=80=9C...having a dedicated or even half-time person who can spen=
d 12-18 months performing really deep dives on a particular research topic =
- say, a rapidly-changing industry trend - could really inject an X-factor =
in terms of strategic direction.=E2=80=9D Do you mean like, an organization=
 that is more proactive in shaping business decisions, as opposed to being =
a task taker? Yes, you can say that. I want my team to do a lot more of,=C2=
=A0=E2=80=9CHey, we dug into the data and discovered that our customers are=
 actually doing X because of Y. Here=E2=80=99s our list of recommended prod=
uct changes in light of these findings, and why we think there=E2=80=99s a =
high probability that we=E2=80=99ll see a resulting change in Z behavior.=
=E2=80=9D In short, I think product analytics has the potential for a treme=
ndous amount of value added to the business if we shift towards a more proa=
ctive approach. Got it. And how do you think that it=E2=80=99d impact the c=
urrent team structure - if any - if you added a strategic analytics focus t=
o the organization? Generally, the structure would be the same, but somethi=
ng I=E2=80=99ve been thinking about, is the creation of a small sub-team - =
let=E2=80=99s call it, tentatively, the performance management team. It wou=
ld focus on executive-level reporting. Let=E2=80=99s say that I=E2=80=99m t=
he CEO or the CPO. What are the three key things I=E2=80=99d need to unders=
tand in the next 12 months to really steer the direction of the company? Ob=
viously, we already cover all of the basic questions, but having a dedicate=
d or even half-time person who can perform analysis in a 12-18 month outloo=
k, performing deep dives on a particular research topic - say, a rapidly-ch=
anging industry trend - could really inject an X-factor in terms of strateg=
ic direction. I envision that such a team, or person, would function indepe=
ndently separate from the current two sub-teams, but it=E2=80=99d likely ne=
ed to collaborate closely with them, as they have deep domain knowledge on =
specific product types. =C2=A0 Managing globally distributed teams We=E2=80=
=99ve spent quite a bit discussing how your org collaborates with external =
stakeholders. Would you share some insight on the intra-team dynamics as we=
ll? Our organization is actually distributed, both geographically and acros=
s time zones. Within the US, we have people on both coasts. Then we have a =
few members in Israel, and we=E2=80=99re in the process of hiring someone i=
n India as well. As you can imagine, this presents challenges in terms of c=
ommunication, and it=E2=80=99s something I=E2=80=99ve had to factor in whil=
e thinking about initiatives for fostering greater collaboration across the=
 team. One of these initiatives is a monthly team meeting, where everyone g=
athers to present their work and interesting findings and learn from each o=
ther. During these sessions, we provide feedback to each others=E2=80=99 wo=
rk, stay up-to-date on team-wide initiatives, and practice our presentation=
 skills. We also are planning cross-team initiatives like Innovation Week, =
where we work on experimental projects, and we will have teams that compris=
e folks from Israel and from the US. =E2=80=9CI think teams do their best w=
ork when they come from different backgrounds, and they=E2=80=99re able to =
pool their creativity as a result of different life experiences.=E2=80=9D A=
h, I had no idea that ZoomInfo had employees in Israel. Do you take culture=
, location, or time zone into account when structuring your teams? The reas=
on I=E2=80=99m asking this is that - I think - for some companies, there=E2=
=80=99d be a temptation to put all the people from the same culture or time=
 zone into one function for sheer convenience. Previously, the sub-teams we=
re distinctly differentiated along time zones/countries. So we had one team=
 comprising folks based in Israel, who reported to an Israel-based manager,=
 and another team comprising folks based in the US, who reported to =C2=A0U=
S-based managers. We=E2=80=99ve since shifted people around so that both te=
ams now have a fairly equal distribution of people based in Israel and in t=
he US. And even though this definitely increases the complexity in terms of=
 communication, I think it=E2=80=99s much better this way. In the previous =
setup, both teams naturally gravitated towards doing their own thing, and t=
here wasn=E2=80=99t great collaboration between the two teams. Now, we have=
 people in both offices sharing the same sprint planning meetings and stand=
ups, and that naturally results in more knowledge sharing. At least to date=
, I=E2=80=99d say we=E2=80=99ve spent more of our energy thinking not about=
 the location of people within our org, but the location of our stakeholder=
s. Nevertheless, we try our very best to make things work. For example, we =
have an analyst based in Israel who=E2=80=99s serving a product team based =
on the West Coast in the US, and her manager can take their questions whene=
ver she=E2=80=99s offline, and vice versa. All this is to say, I=E2=80=99m =
definitely mindful of the challenges of managing a geographically distribut=
ed team. I=E2=80=99m aware, for example, that I have more frequent organic =
catch-ups with the US team since we see each other in the office. As a resu=
lt, I have to be proactive in creating interactions with the team in Israel=
, and make sure that I=E2=80=99m up-to-date with their concerns and what th=
ey=E2=80=99ve been working on. I appreciate that you took deliberate action=
 in restructuring the org from having de facto US-based and Israel-based te=
ams, into teams with a mix of people from both countries. I once worked in =
a company that had all-Russian data engineering. I=E2=80=99m sure that it w=
as advantageous in some ways, such as having a natural camaraderie within t=
he team, but they were also socially disconnected from everyone else. And I=
 wish we had a manager like you who=E2=80=99d have done something about it.=
 Thank you, but I want to take a step back from organizational design to th=
e topic of hiring practices in general, which obviously also contributes to=
 what you can do in terms of designing your team. I think teams do their be=
st work when they come from different backgrounds, and they=E2=80=99re able=
 to pool their creativity as a result of different life experiences. I lear=
ned this while working at Deloitte; it being a mega-corporation where we ha=
d people from the entire globe and as many industries as you could imagine =
working together. I strongly believe that the most diverse teams are also t=
he most innovative ones, and I value a company that reflects this across al=
l levels of the organization. =C2=A0 Effective performance tracking You=E2=
=80=99re looking after a dozen people, which is a fair amount. How do you k=
eep tabs on team performance without micromanaging, especially when they=E2=
=80=99re serving multiple stakeholders and across different time zones? How=
 do you know if they=E2=80=99re meeting expectations? Firstly, one of the t=
hings I created when I began my role at ZoomInfo, was a universal performan=
ce-tracking framework that can be used by any employee on our team. It cont=
ains a clear explanation of the general standards of excellence that we exp=
ect as a company, as well as the specific benchmarks that we use to grade e=
mployees at different levels. For example, we=E2=80=99d expect people above=
 a certain level to be able to demonstrate certain leadership principles. I=
t didn=E2=80=99t exist before, but now that it does, I hope it provides a s=
tandardized and consistent methodology for performance tracking. Secondly, =
I count on my managers to keep me up to date on the day-to-day workings of =
their respective teams. For example, if there are performance issues with a=
 specific individual, I=E2=80=99d expect them to escalate to me as soon as =
possible. Last but not least, I now meet with everyone in my organization a=
t least once a month no matter their level. Even if I don=E2=80=99t have co=
mplete knowledge of what everyone is working on, I can still get a sense of=
 who=E2=80=99s going above and beyond, and who=E2=80=99s merely going with =
the flow by paying close attention to things like how well-prepared someone=
 is when they show up for our 1-on-1s. These simultaneous conversations als=
o help me triangulate observations within the team. It allows me to ask que=
stions, like, =E2=80=9CHey, I=E2=80=99ve spoken with X and Y, and they=E2=
=80=99ve both commented that they=E2=80=99ve been facing Z challenge. Has t=
his been your experience as well?=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s my job as =
a leader to make sure that you as an individual are getting to where you wa=
nt to go. But it=E2=80=99s also on you to make sure that you have a clear v=
iew of what you really want, career-wise.=E2=80=9D =C2=A0 Nevertheless, I u=
ltimately expect everyone to be responsible for their own journey within th=
e organization, and within the company. Say, someone is interested in going=
 into data engineering. I=E2=80=99d of course prefer if they stay in my tea=
m, but at the same time, I=E2=80=99d do whatever I can to support their tra=
nsition. I=E2=80=99d even extend that to individuals who want to move on fr=
om ZoomInfo entirely. It=E2=80=99s my job as a leader to make sure that you=
 as an individual are getting to where you want to go. But it=E2=80=99s als=
o on you to make sure that you have a clear view of what you really want, c=
areer-wise. Michael, I appreciate the candidness with which you=E2=80=99ve =
shared your insights in this conversation. You=E2=80=99re welcome, it was a=
 pleasure! What do you think of the above? Given this is something complete=
ly new, please hit the "Reply" button and let us know what you think. You c=

turing the org from having de facto US-based and Israel-based teams, into t=
eams with a mix of people from both countries. I once worked in a company t=
hat had all-Russian data engineering. I=E2=80=99m sure that it was advantag=
eous in some ways, such as having a natural camaraderie within the team, bu=
t they were also socially disconnected from everyone else. And I wish we ha=

p><p style=3D"margin: 0; font-weight: 400; margin-top: 0.8em; font-size: 1e=

zational design to the topic of hiring practices in general, which obviousl=
y also contributes to what you can do in terms of designing your team.</p><=
p style=3D"margin: 0; font-weight: 400; margin-top: 0.8em; font-size: 1em; =
line-height: 1.5;">I think teams do their best work when they come from dif=
ferent backgrounds, and they=E2=80=99re able to pool their creativity as a =
result of different life experiences. I learned this while working at Deloi=
tte; it being a mega-corporation where we had people from the entire globe =
and as many industries as you could imagine working together.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0; font-weight: 400; margin-top: 0.8em; font-size: 1em; line-he=

t innovative ones, and I value a company that reflects this across all leve=
ls of the organization.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0; font-weight: 400; margin-=

p><p style=3D"margin: 0; font-weight: 400; margin-top: 0.8em; font-size: 1e=
m; line-height: 1.5;">Firstly, one of the things I created when I began my =
role at ZoomInfo, was a universal performance-tracking framework that can b=
e used by any employee on our team.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0; font-weight: =
400; margin-top: 0.8em; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5;">It contains a cl=
ear explanation of the general standards of excellence that we expect as a =
company, as well as the specific benchmarks that we use to grade employees =
at different levels. For example, we=E2=80=99d expect people above a certai=
n level to be able to demonstrate certain leadership principles.</p><p styl=
e=3D"margin: 0; font-weight: 400; margin-top: 0.8em; font-size: 1em; line-h=

t provides a standardized and consistent methodology for performance tracki=
ng.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0; font-weight: 400; margin-top: 0.8em; font-siz=
e: 1em; line-height: 1.5;">Secondly, I count on my managers to keep me up t=
o date on the day-to-day workings of their respective teams. For example, i=
f there are performance issues with a specific individual, I=E2=80=99d expe=
ct them to escalate to me as soon as possible.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0; fo=
nt-weight: 400; margin-top: 0.8em; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5;">Last =
but not least, I now meet with everyone in my organization at least once a =
month no matter their level. Even if I don=E2=80=99t have complete knowledg=
e of what everyone is working on, I can still get a sense of who=E2=80=99s =
going above and beyond, and who=E2=80=99s merely going with the flow by pay=

how up for our 1-on-1s.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0; font-weight: 400; margin-=
top: 0.8em; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5;">These simultaneous conversat=
ions also help me triangulate observations within the team. It allows me to=
 ask questions, like, =E2=80=9CHey, I=E2=80=99ve spoken with X and Y, and t=
