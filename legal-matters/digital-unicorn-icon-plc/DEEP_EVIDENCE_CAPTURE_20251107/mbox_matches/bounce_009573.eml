 Engages Global Geospatial Audience At INTERGEO 2025 WGIC participated in I=
NTERGEO Expo & Conference in Frankfurt, Germany, bringing together global g=
eospatial leaders to advance innovation, workforce development, and industr=
y collaboration. Over three dynamic days, WGIC hosted panels, meetings, and=
 a networking reception focused on shaping the future of geospatial technol=
ogies. On October 7, the panel =E2=80=9CData to Decisions=E2=80=9D brought =
together experts from RIEGL, Woolpert, DATADEV, PlanBlue, Bluesky, and Esri=
. Moderated by John Renard, the panel discussed how geospatial data transfo=
rms decision-making across sectors. The session drew an audience of over 10=
0 participants, reflecting the growing interest in how advances in data pro=
duction and processing workflows are transforming the way we generate, inte=
rpret, and apply geospatial information. With faster and more efficient cap=
ture methods=E2=80=94from mobile mapping to satellite and aerial systems=E2=
=80=94participants discussed how the industry is achieving new levels of sc=
alability and precision across the value chain. The lively discussion highl=
ighted how AI-driven information extraction and automation are enabling the=
 creation of product stacks that go beyond visualization to deliver true de=
cision intelligence. The session reinforced a shared vision among WGIC memb=
ers: turning data into trusted, actionable insights is key to realizing the=
 full potential of the geospatial sector. The final day, October 9, feature=
d two standout sessions: The panel, =E2=80=9CThe Future of Earth Observatio=
n,=E2=80=9D with speakers from Sparkgeo - Applied Geospatial, Bentley Syste=
ms, EOMAP, Wingtra, GeoSolutions, Esri, discussed innovations in satellite =

orks that trace data integrity from pixels to attributes. The session, with=
 an audience of 75+, underscored that transparency and accountability in ge=
ospatial data impact every part of our industry. The panel was followed by =
a session on =E2=80=9CGeospatial Workforce=E2=80=9D presented by WGIC Execu=
tive Director Aaron Addison, who highlighted the evolving skillsets, challe=
nges, and opportunities shaping the next generation of geospatial professio=
nals. The session drew over 40 engaged participants and featured a dynamic =
15-minute Q&A. Questions ranged from the relevance of current university mo=
dels amid rapid tech change to how AI is reshaping skills and job availabil=
ity. Participants also explored how upskilling, reskilling, and flexible ta=
lent models can meet the growing demand for geospatial expertise. The discu=
ssion reflected a shared sense of urgency and optimism about how academia a=
nd industry can collaborate to equip the next generation of geospatial prof=
essionals. WGIC Strengthens Ties With Surveying Community In Ireland WGIC A=
ssociate Director Helen Gilmartin attended the SCSI - Society of Chartered =
Surveyors Ireland (SCSI) event in Dublin, engaging with professionals from =
across the geospatial and surveying sectors. The gathering provided an exce=
