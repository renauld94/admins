=99ve learned a lot about how to manage their careers =E2=80=94 from negoti=
ating better to spotting the right opportunities. _[**Follow me on LinkedIn=

----------## How I build my network in 3 mins a day

Picture it:

There=E2=80=99s two guys, and both have the same good start in life -=C2=A0=
 they come from good families, have good friends, and graduate from good un=
iversities.=C2=A0

But=E2=80=A6

While the first guy goes on to have an incredible career, the second become=
s a =E2=80=9Cbum=E2=80=9D, who flits from dead-end job to dead-end job, nev=
er using the skills he knows he should be using.

Now, here=E2=80=99s the plot-twist:

_They=E2=80=99re the same guy!=C2=A0_

Specifically, they=E2=80=99re both Jeff Olson, who wrote the book _The Slig=
ht Edge_. As he explains, there was one simple difference between him being=
 a winner and him being a bum:

Both Jeffs tried to build good habits.

But while =E2=80=9Cbeach-bum=E2=80=9D Jeff didn=E2=80=99t stick at them, su=
ccessful Jeff did.=C2=A0

His point:

**Tiny actions, done everyday, lead to life-changing differences over time*=
*.

_And nowhere is this more true than networking_.=C2=A0

>From the comments I read, you=E2=80=99d think networking is like drawing bl=
ood from a stone.=C2=A0

But really?=C2=A0

Networking is incredibly _easy_=E2=80=A6 as long as you keep up with a few =
simple habits.

What are these habits?

Well, there=E2=80=99s a few, but today I=E2=80=99d like to focus on just on=
e.

----------
**=E2=80=A6by the way, if you use LinkedIn, **_**[go to my profile](https:/=
/www.linkedin.com/in/rohanmahtani/)**_** and hit the =E2=80=98Follow=E2=80=
=99 button**. I share a mix of practical career strategy and mid-week motiv=
ation =E2=80=94=C2=A0stuff that makes it easy to keep your career on track.=
=20

_**Topics coming up**_: how to get promoted faster than others, how to conn=
ect with recruiters, and how to build instant rapport with people (even sen=
ior leaders). _[See you there](https://www.linkedin.com/comm/mynetwork/disc=
overy-see-all?usecase=3DPEOPLE_FOLLOWS&followMember=3Drohanmahtani)_.

alright, let=E2=80=99s get back to my essay=E2=80=A6


----------Let me introduce you to the man I got it from:

### =F0=9F=8C=AA=EF=B8=8F**  The busiest man (& best networker) in the worl=
d?**

Jesse Itzler is=E2=80=A6 well, a beast.

He=E2=80=99s a CEO, a rapper, and author of best-selling books. He=E2=80=99=
s lived with monks, trained with navy seals, runs ultramarathons for fun, a=
nd is the part-owner of an NBA team. On top of this, he=E2=80=99s also a hu=
ge family man.

So as you might imagine, he=E2=80=99s a kinda busy guy.=C2=A0

And yet, somehow, Jesse finds the time (& energy) to grow and maintain an i=
ncredible network.=C2=A0

Question is=E2=80=A6

_**How?**_

Here=E2=80=99s his secret:

### =F0=9F=A4=9F**  3 C=E2=80=99s in 3 minutes**

Everyday, Jesse either **congratulates, compliments or consoles. **(taking =
him ~3 mins to do).

Let=E2=80=99s break =E2=80=98em down:

### =F0=9F=A5=B3 ** Congratulate: **

Everyday, someone you know has finally achieved something they=E2=80=99ve i=
nvested buckets of blood, sweat and tears into. But the sad part? Chances a=
re, not even their spouses will congratulate them!=C2=A0

And that=E2=80=99s where you come in:

Send them a text, or a message, or an email to give them props. (N.B _**Don=
=E2=80=99t**_ just be lazy by liking their LinkedIn post - put some effort =
in).

**This is super easy to start doing**. You=E2=80=99re probably already on L=
inkedIn a few times a week. The next time you see someone switch jobs, star=
t a new role, or share good news, send them a short DM to say congratulatio=
ns.=20

### **=F0=9F=91=8D  Compliment: **

Know what else happens everyday?

You (yes, you!) are benefitting from the advice, lessons or help you got fr=
om someone in the past. So, why not thank them for it?

* _=E2=80=9CHey Tim, you probably don=E2=80=99t remember, but back in 2019 =
you told me to take a writing workshop because it=E2=80=99d be good for my =
career.=C2=A0 Long story short, I signed up for it, and these days I=E2=80=
=99m writing my own newsletter - all thanks to your advice. I just want to =
say, thanks!=E2=80=9D_

Because it=E2=80=99s genuine, specific, and =E2=80=9Cout of the blue=E2=80=
=9D, I can guarantee they=E2=80=99ll remember it for years to come.=C2=A0Ma=
ke sure it=E2=80=99s specific =E2=80=94=C2=A0saying =E2=80=9CTwo years ago =
you told me X and I did Y as a result. I=E2=80=99ll never forget it. Thanks=
!=E2=80=9D is much better than just =E2=80=9CThanks for being a good friend=
!=E2=80=9D

(p.s. Often, what stops us from saying =E2=80=98thank you=E2=80=99 is think=
ing that we=E2=80=99ve missed our chance. But actually, a delayed thank-you=
 (sometimes years later) is better, because with hindsight you can apprecia=
te the value of what that person=E2=80=99s done for you.)

This also takes just a minute to do. Think of an ex-boss you value, an old =
friend/family member you haven=E2=80=99t spoken to in a lil=E2=80=99 bit, o=
r a content creator who adds to your life. Say thanks!

### =F0=9F=98=A3**  Console**

If you have someone in your life that's grieving or going through a tough t=
ime, reach out.=20

It=E2=80=99s not just nice knowing someone else cares. It=E2=80=99s when th=
ey need to hear from you the most.

Now=E2=80=A6

Do you need to Congratulate, Compliment or Console everyday? Well, it depen=
ds how =E2=80=9Ctight=E2=80=9D you want your network to be.

My suggestion?

### =F0=9F=93=85**  ****Pick a networking day**

Baby steps first:

Try the 3Cs out **one day a week**, and make it a habit. Choose a =E2=80=9C=
3C day=E2=80=9D, then pick one person you can congratulate, compliment **or=
** console.

Do this for a year, and watch what happens.

I=E2=80=99d be very surprised if you didn=E2=80=99t have an extra 52 people=
 thinking a lot more highly of you.

And if you did enjoy reading this email=E2=80=A6

(I don=E2=80=99t ask you for a lot=E2=80=A6.rather, these emails are expens=
ive to send out, yet I keep them free and don=E2=80=99t clutter them with a=
ds)

Do me a favor and either:

1. **Tell a friend about these emails**. **[Here=E2=80=99s a link](https://=
link.resumeworded.com/share-the-email)** to share the series so they get th=
e next one, or tell them to go to _[Coached.com](http://Coached.com)__ to s=
ign up._

2. **Engage with me on ****[any of my recent LinkedIn posts](https://www.li=
nkedin.com/in/rohanmahtani/recent-activity/all/)** =E2=80=94=C2=A0if you li=
ke what I write here, you=E2=80=99ll enjoy what I write there too.

3. **[Leave a review](https://resumeworded.com/leave-a-review-newsletter)**=
 for Coached.

Stuff like this helps and makes all the efforts feel worth it =E2=80=94=C2=
=A0thank you.=20

## How many jobs should you apply for in 2024?

_Read the full article __[here](https://resumeworded.com/how-many-jobs-shou=
ld-i-apply-for-key-advice)__._

A statistic that's often passed around is 1 callback for every 50 applicati=
ons. But we've found that this isn't accurate =E2=80=94 you can 5x the numb=
er of callbacks by making a few tweaks to each application.

**=F0=9F=97=A3=EF=B8=8F =C2=A0Avoid resume bombing. **Quality over quantity=
. Avoid sending out applications to jobs you might not be qualified for at =
all. Make sure you apply to jobs in your niche =E2=80=94 e.g. those related=
 to your major, industry, skillset, or level of seniority.

=F0=9F=8E=AF =C2=A0To make sure your resume is effective, upload your resum=
e to [this tool](https://resumeworded.com/score). It'll analyze each line o=
n your resume and tell you how to improve each one, so you'll get past the =
resume screeners and hiring managers.

=F0=9F=A7=90** =C2=A0Targeting your resume does not mean you have to rewrit=
e your resume for every single job. **Just tweak the skills section of your=
 resume at the minimum =E2=80=94 [this resume targeting tool](https://resum=
eworded.com/targeted-resume) will help. And use [this cover letter generato=
r](https://resumeworded.com/ai-cover-letter-generator) to create a unique c=
over letter per job application.

=F0=9F=93=88** =C2=A0Use niche job sites: **Avoid the Indeeds or Monsters o=
f the world. [Niche sites](https://resumeworded.com/best-sites-for-your-res=
ume-key-advice) have less competition.

----------## If you=E2=80=99re new here, hi!

Hey, I'm Rohan. Some people are into yoga, others are into fishing - me, I'=
m all about self-improvement. Years ago, I got fed up with the fluff that p=
asses for career advice out there. So, I started Resume Worded and this ema=
il series, Coached, to share the industry insider info I was learning.

Think of this email as your weekly dose of career coaching you didn't know =
you needed. No fluff, no platitudes, no-BS =E2=80=94 just real stuff that y=
ou need to hear to shape your career into what you want it to be.

Until next time,
