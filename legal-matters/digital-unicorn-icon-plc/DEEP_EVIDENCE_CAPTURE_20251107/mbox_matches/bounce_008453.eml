----------## The =E2=80=9Cprestige=E2=80=9D trap

In his famous newsletter=E2=80=A6

Gary Halbert, (the so-called =E2=80=9CPrince of Print=E2=80=9D) wrote about=
 owning two very different watches:

First, there was his =E2=80=9CKGB=E2=80=9D watch=E2=80=A6

Which, although being nothing to write home about, was easy to read (chunky=
 numbers), water-proof enough to go on a spearfishing trip, and was so toug=
h, it=E2=80=99d probably still be tickin=E2=80=99 if a tank rolled over it.=
=C2=A0

Plus, you could show people at parties (or not) the secret compartment wher=
e KGB agents hid their cyanide pills back in the day.

Oh, and if Gary lost it?

It=E2=80=99d only cost him $80 to replace.

Then, there was Gary=E2=80=99s $10,000 Rolex, one of the most prestigious w=
atches in the world.=C2=A0

Was it nice to have on his wrist?

Sure.

But=E2=80=A6

He had to squint to make out the tiny Roman numerals (which were the same c=
olour as the background), and parts of it would randomly break, costing him=
 thousands to replace.

And what=E2=80=99s worse?

It was such a famous watch=E2=80=A6

**It made him a target for =E2=80=9CRolex thieves=E2=80=9D that wouldn=E2=
=80=99t hesitate to **_**chop off his arm**_** to get it!**

So=E2=80=A6

While the Rolex might get him a nod once a year at the country club=E2=80=
=A6=C2=A0

Did it make Gary=E2=80=99s life better in any way?=C2=A0

No.=C2=A0

Not only was it a pain in the ass to read=E2=80=A6

It could=E2=80=99ve gotten him killed!=C2=A0

Moral of the story:

Chasing prestige for prestige=E2=80=99s sake is a sucker=E2=80=99s game.=C2=
=A0

**And it=E2=80=99s the same with chasing prestigious careers too.=C2=A0**

I mean, I can count on, I dunno, 5 hands, the number of people I know who d=
evoted years of blood, sweat and tears to join the Harvards, the Goldman Sa=
chs, the McKinseys, and the Googles of the world.

And you know what?

10 years later, most of them have told me the same thing:

**=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m not fulfilled=E2=80=9D**

=E2=80=99s not for you, even though the world tells you it=E2=80=99s suppos=

Seeking prestige for its own sake can lead you down a path of unfulfilling =
career choices.

So=E2=80=A6

If you=E2=80=99re hearing the siren song calling you down a =E2=80=9Cpresti=
gious=E2=80=9D career path, here=E2=80=99s a few things to keep in mind bef=
ore you make the jump.

### =F0=9F=98=B7**  **_**Are you infected?**_

Ok, be honest:

Do you want the job for YOUR sake?=C2=A0

Or, are you infected with a bad case of _the disease to please_?=C2=A0

You might be trying to please your parents (I know the feeling!), or to =E2=
=80=9Cplease=E2=80=9D (i.e make jealous) your classmates at a reunion=E2=80=
=A6 or please the good-looking strangers at the bar.

Sure, there are a few noble reasons to taking a job for pleasing others (li=
ke, for example, feeding your family), but in most cases, if it=E2=80=99s g=
onna make you miserable for 40 years, is it really worth it?

Remember, social validation and approval are nice to have, but they shouldn=
't be the driving force behind your career decisions.

----------Put another way:

Which path would improve your basketball skills faster:

Sitting on the bench for the NBA champs, carrying towels and gatorade? Or b=
y joining the lowly Nets and playing 40 minutes a night? (No offense, Nets =
fans).

Think about it in the business world:

You could be a senior manager at a smaller firm, making decisions and honin=
g your leadership skills=E2=80=A6

=E2=80=A6or an associate at a prestigious firm, stuck doing grunt work and =
waiting for your chance to shine.

9 times out of 10, the less prestigious role will give you more opportuniti=
es for growth and impact (stuff that will serve your career a lot more long=
er term =E2=80=94=C2=A0hiring managers prefer to see real impact over a big=
 name)

_Final thought:_

I=E2=80=99m not trying to =E2=80=9Cpooh-pooh=E2=80=9D every big, prestigiou=
s company.=C2=A0

Some of them do great, important work, and provide thousands of people with=
 exciting, fulfilling careers.=C2=A0

Just bear in mind=E2=80=A6

A lot of it __is__ hype=E2=80=A6

And I'm not saying they're all bad. I just want to give you a framework to =
make decisions in your career. Just because a company seems more prestigiou=
s doesn=E2=80=99t mean its the right role for you.

And the last thing I=E2=80=99d want you to do is chase an unfulfilling care=
er purely to make your LinkedIn profile good.=20

Especially when all you need to do is go [here](https://resumeworded.com/li=
nkedin-review/optimize-linkedin-profile)[ ](https://resumeworded.com/linked=
in-review/optimize-linkedin-profile)[to optimize your profile](https://resu=
meworded.com/linkedin-review/optimize-linkedin-profile) (an optimized Linke=
dIn profile will do more for you than any big name)

=E2=80=A6so that=E2=80=99s my rant on prestige.=20

Before I wrap up, I need something from you.

These emails take me freakin=E2=80=99 forever to write up. And cost a lot i=
n email sending costs. But yet I don=E2=80=99t litter them with ads nor pay=
wall the best parts.=20

That said, there is a (non-monetary) fee for them:=20

If an email changes the way you think, opens your mind to a new perspective=
, or gives you an insight you get value from, please do one of these things=
:

1. Tell a friend about these emails. **[Here=E2=80=99s a link](https://link=
.resumeworded.com/share-the-email)** to share the series so they get the ne=
xt one, or tell them to go to _[Coached.com](http://Coached.com)__ to sign =
up._

2. Engage with me on **[any of my recent LinkedIn posts](https://www.linked=
in.com/in/rohanmahtani/recent-activity/all/)** =E2=80=94=C2=A0if you like w=
hat I write here, you=E2=80=99ll enjoy that too.

3. **[Leave a review](https://resumeworded.com/leave-a-review-newsletter)**=
 for Coached.

Stuff like this helps and makes all the efforts feel worth it =E2=80=94=C2=
=A0thank you.=20

## How to list projects on your resume

_Read the full article __[here](https://resumeworded.com/blog/projects-on-r=
esume/)__ (it has some good examples too)._

If you don't have enough relevant experience in the industry you're applyin=
g to =E2=80=94 perhaps you're a career changer or a student =E2=80=94 it's =
a good idea to include a projects section on your resume where you highligh=
t personal projects, side hustles or volunteering work.

For example, if you're trying to break into digital marketing and don't hav=
e marketing experience, you might use a projects section to describe how yo=
u created a personal website and used Facebook Ads to market it.

=F0=9F=8E=AF =C2=A0If you're working on your resume, I'd really recommend u=
sing a tool like [Score My Resume](https://resumeworded.com/score). It'll s=
can your work experiences and projects (if you added any) and give you inst=
ant suggestions on how to rewrite them using AI and recruiter advice. =C2=

----------## If you=E2=80=99re new here, hi!

Hey, I'm Rohan. Some people are into yoga, others are into fishing - me, I'=
m all about self-improvement. Years ago, I got fed up with the fluff that p=
asses for career advice out there. So, I started Resume Worded and this ema=
il series, Coached, to share the industry insider info I was learning.

Think of this email as your weekly dose of career coaching you didn't know =
you needed. No fluff, no platitudes, no-BS =E2=80=94 just real stuff that y=
ou need to hear to shape your career into what you want it to be.

Until next time,
