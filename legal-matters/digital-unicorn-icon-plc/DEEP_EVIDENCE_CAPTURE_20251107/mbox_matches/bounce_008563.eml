In case you missed our previous issues and are curious what this is, the id=
ea is simple:=C2=A0We interview seasoned data leaders to learn how they bui=
lt, scaled,=C2=A0and designed=C2=A0effective data teams. For this episode o=
f Designing Data Organizations, we spoke with Christine Jiang, former Direc=
tor of Core Analytics at Vimeo, who was with the organization between 2020 =
and 2024. Our staff writer, Gabriel Y. W. Zhang, conducted and synthesized =
the interview. Some Key Learning Points The analytics team at Vimeo was ini=
tially sliced by stakeholder verticals (product, marketing, etc.), but it w=
as restructured to slice by data functionality. This reorganization had the=
 advantage of allowing new teams like Core Analytics to focus on building c=
ohesive shared data assets. To roll out data team reorganizations strategic=
ally, analytics should consider individual preferences for job types, timel=
ines, and the relationship between data engineers and data analysts. Aligni=
ng data analysts to metrics is unconventional, but it incentivizes analysts=
 to go deeper in understanding these numbers. The collaboration between ana=
lytics teams at Vimeo evolved along with the org restructure. As part of th=
eir inclusivity initiatives, Vimeo is accounting for personality fit for ro=
le suitability, which is especially vital for analytics leadership position=
s. Soft skills will be increasingly valued among data analysts, as more and=
 more of the low-level work is handled by AI, leaving analysts to focus on =
higher-level work that requires more collaboration and strategic thinking. =
The traditional distinctions between data analysts, data engineers, data sc=
ientists have blended significantly within the last decade, as data roles e=
volve at a rapid pace. Core Analytics at Vimeo Gabriel Zhang: Hi Christine,=
 congratulations on launching the Analytics Accelerator. I can=E2=80=99t wa=
it to see how your programme inspires a new generation of data analytics ex=
perts! But for now, I=E2=80=99m interested in hearing about your experience=
 leading the Core Analytics team at Vimeo. Christine: Thank you, I=E2=80=99=
m really excited about this project too! Sure, let=E2=80=99s get into Vimeo=
. The whole company is about 1,200 people, of which about 2% - or 25 people=
 - are made up of pure analytics specialists. Historically, we had a =E2=80=
=9Cclassic=E2=80=9D team architecture, whereby analytics was divided into s=
takeholder verticals such as marketing, product, enterprise sales, etc. Eac=
h vertical consisted of up to five data analysts, all of which funneled int=
o a VP of data who, in turn, reported to the Chief Product Officer. Within =
this structure, I served as director of core financial analytics for one an=
d a half years. However, one drawback of this setup is that it=E2=80=99s no=
t easy for the leadership to get a comprehensive and holistic view of what=
=E2=80=99s happening across all the verticals. So the analytics function wa=
s restructured last year to slice by data functionality rather than by stak=
eholder verticals. My own role too, was revamped to build up the Core Analy=
tics team. Basically, we focused on analytics team enablement, including de=
veloping the central data infrastructure and tooling used by all the other =
analytics teams. I can=E2=80=99t speak in detail about the other three pods=
 after the reorganization, but they focused on business insights, data scie=
nce, and product analytics respectively. =E2=80=9CBut when your analytics o=
rganization is sliced by verticals like marketing, sales=E2=80=A6 Who is go=
ing to build this single, cohesive source of truth unless you have a team d=
edicated to its development, progression, and adoption?=E2=80=9D I=E2=80=99=
ve spoken to a few other analytics leaders at orgs of a similar size, and t=
hey=E2=80=99ve mentioned similar reorg experiences in the past few years. Y=
eah, I think this is something borne out of a need for more mature data tea=
ms as a startup grows. Once your data team exceeds six or seven people, wha=
t happens is that you=E2=80=99ll have multiple people reporting similar met=
rics on different dashboards and reports, but they=E2=80=99re all defined s=
lightly differently, and the numbers don=E2=80=99t align. I should point ou=
t that Vimeo IPO=E2=80=99ed in 2021. When you become a public company, ther=
e is a much higher level of scrutiny around data governance. That requires =
having a centralized semantic layer, renovating the underlying data archite=
cture, creating AI-powered data libraries, and so on. But when your analyti=
cs organization is sliced by verticals like marketing, sales=E2=80=A6 Who i=
s going to build this single, cohesive source of truth unless you have a te=
am dedicated to its development and maintenance? Indeed. And I always think=
 that the analytics team that works on central tooling gets the projects th=
at are both the most fun and intellectually-challenging, since they pretty =
much build the backbone for the rest of the analytics function. Yep. The Co=
re Analytics team was a pretty cross-functional one, in the sense that my n=
ew stakeholders were no longer a specific group such as finance, but all th=
e other data pod leaders. Responsibility-wise, my role also became much mor=
e project management-oriented. To give you an example, one of our key proje=
cts was an AI data catalog. As we were building out a single-source-of-trut=
h metrics layer to centralize and standardize our metric definitions and co=
de, the project grew to four data engineers and five analysts, plus 1-2 oth=
er leads over the course of five months. The team structure for the initiat=
ive had to be fluid, because we needed both specialists and generalists. To=
 build the metrics layer, we needed people who brought their knowledge from=
 certain domains, while the generalists would work on more mundane data pro=
duct development work. For months at a time, we=E2=80=99d have engineers an=
d analysts who rotated between focusing on their respective pods and partic=
ipating in this initiative, and I spent a great deal of time liaising with =
them to make sure that we built a cohesive product. Restructuring Data Team=
s Effectively While we=E2=80=99re on the topic of team restructuring, I=E2=
=80=99d love to ask: For the ICs (data engineers, data analysts) whose job =
scopes were affected, how did they react to the changes? Frankly, I think t=
here were a lot of mixed feelings. However, I=E2=80=99d add that they weren=
=E2=80=99t always a reaction to the changes within the data team itself, bu=
t also the consequence of a macro environment that=E2=80=99s been experienc=
ing a lot of turbulence and uncertainty lately. Nevertheless, it can defini=
tely come across as a disappointment to individuals who were, say, settled =
in a certain specialization that they excelled in, but are suddenly shifted=
 into a function that might not seem as exciting. On the bright side, it wa=
s also a welcomed change for some other people. For example, for some of th=
e folks who were moved into data science, that=E2=80=99s a positive develop=
ment for their career trajectory as the previous setup allocated very littl=
e space for data science work since there wasn=E2=80=99t a dedicated DS tea=
m. Post-restructuring, the goal was that they would be able to work on data=
 science projects with goals that were distinct from those of general busin=
ess intelligence. Thanks a lot for answering that. The reason I asked is be=
cause, like you said, the macro environment is pretty rocky at the moment. =
I imagine that a lot of analytics leaders have had to deal with the psychol=
ogical consequences of these changes, and the resentment that sometimes see=
ps through from people whose roles were affected negatively. Do you have an=
y personal thoughts or recommendations on how to roll out analytics reorgan=
izations in an effective manner? Well, thoughtful leaders of course aim to =
have a deeper understanding of how the day-to-day work experience of every =
individual in the organization will be affected by any proposed team restru=
cturing. Quite often, when organizational decisions are made at a higher le=
vel, a lot of things fall through the cracks. An example would be the desig=
nation of new team leads. In a small to medium-sized company where working =
styles are really fluid, management sometimes takes it for granted that if =
someone=E2=80=99s really good in a certain skill, or has a personality that=
 gels across all teams, they=E2=80=99d want to assume the mantle of tech or=
 team lead in a reorganization. But that=E2=80=99s just an assumption and d=
oesn=E2=80=99t always reflect the reality of how people feel about their ne=
w roles. Secondly, it=E2=80=99s important to think about the longer-term tr=
ajectory of the business before pushing through a reorganization. Sometimes=
, leaders intuit correctly that there are gaps within an organization, and =
they react quickly to address these gaps, without realizing that they may b=
e a temporary problem. For example, if a company is planning to move from b=
eing B2C to B2B-focused within the next 12 months, you know that the teams =
will need to be realigned eventually anyway. So even if there are issues wi=
th the current org design, it=E2=80=99s probably worth waiting until the bi=
g changes at the business model level have been implemented first before in=
itiating a reorganization, instead of having multiple reorgs in quick succe=
ssion within a year. =E2=80=9CAnother thing I=E2=80=99d suggest to modern d=
ata teams is to align analysts to metrics=E2=80=A6 =E2=80=A6I know that thi=
s is unconventional, but there are advantages to doing this.=E2=80=9D Oh ye=
ah, we all know of companies that are guilty of implementing reorg after re=
org. That can=E2=80=99t be great for talent retention, or hiring. Yeah. Ano=
ther thing I=E2=80=99d suggest to modern data teams is to align analysts to=
 metrics, instead of placing them by stakeholder verticals (marketing, fina=
nce, product, etc.). I know that this is unconventional, but there are adva=
ntages to doing this. The first is that companies care more and more about =
their North Star KPIs these days, so it makes sense to structure their anal=
ytics teams to revolve around them. Secondly, it incentivizes analysts to w=
ork in a different way; it motivates them to conduct deeper dives into spec=
ific numbers, as opposed to a more pedestrian approach when their official =
job scope doesn=E2=80=99t go beyond general reporting. That=E2=80=99s a ver=
y interesting idea. I=E2=80=99ve never seen it myself, but I love the idea =
of an analytics org structure that is spliced by metric families. I=E2=80=
=99d also recommend that analytics leaders consider what kind of relationsh=
ip they want to see between data engineering and data analytics, e.g. wheth=
er DE should sit with DA under one big data umbrella, or if they should bel=
ong to separate departments, because this significantly changes the effecti=
veness of the working relationship between the two groups. I think this is =
less important in small startups since they=E2=80=99ll naturally work close=
ly together. But when you grow into a medium-sized company, maintaining the=
 cohesiveness of data - having universally defined metrics, streamlined dat=
a assets, one common source of truth, etc. - becomes quite challenging. And=
 you want the engineers and analysts to work as closely as possible even if=
 they=E2=80=99re located in different departments. Like, you=E2=80=99d want=
 the data engineers to be equally mindful of the business context, and shar=
e the same sense of urgency as the data analysts. Would you also be willing=
 to give us insights on the collaboration practices within the analytics or=
g? I assumed that must have morphed along with the team org. The collaborat=
ion style of the analytics org at Vimeo actually evolved significantly over=
 the years. Back when we were a small team of five to ten analysts, we used=
 to do team-wide sprint planning every two weeks, and we shared a single ti=
cketing system. When the analytics function grew into four distinct vertica=
ls, each vertical started to function as an independent data team. So while=
 we would all use JIRA, each vertical had its own sprint plans, quarterly p=
riorities, and stakeholder meetings of different cadences. And then the way=
 we=E2=80=99d come together, is that we=E2=80=99d conduct monthly demos, sh=
are wider, monthly meetings with the data engineering team, as well as peri=
odic open working sessions where we=E2=80=99d whiteboard different ideas an=
d long-term goals for the analytics organization as a whole. But post-restr=
ucturing, we had to change our collaboration style again. If you think abou=
t it=E2=80=A6 if you have one pod that is focused on data science, and anot=
her on reporting, they=E2=80=99d be sharing several metrics and data marts.=
 It made no sense to replicate them for each pod, so we needed data assets =
that are flexible and reusable by each pod, and building these things requi=
res close collaboration. From a project management standpoint, the intra-te=
am communications varied quite a bit among the teams. For Core Analytics, w=
e largely operated as an independent team, because while I=E2=80=99d liaise=
 with the other team leads on prioritization planning, the day-to-day work =
of my team doesn=E2=80=99t really require detailed inputs from the other te=
ams. The other three teams - Business insights, Data science, and Product A=
nalytics - on the other hand, operated with a matrix model, which meant the=
y all touched on a little bit of the other teams=E2=80=99 aspects. Lastly, =
most of the Product Analytics team is based in Israel. Because of the time =
zone and geographical separation, their sprint planning and prioritization =
were a bit more separated from the rest of the analytics organization. The =
Modern Analytics Leader I didn=E2=80=99t know that Vimeo had an Israel offi=
ce. It=E2=80=99s because Vimeo acquired a company a few years ago that was =
based in Israel, and Product Analytics was shaped around that existing team=
. In fact, Vimeo=E2=80=99s data team was split at one point across five dif=
ferent time zones: India, Israel, New York, California, and Japan. I=E2=80=
=99m glad the topic of geographically distributed teams came up. It=E2=80=
=99s something that I want to explore a bit further, given that more and mo=
re analytics organizations - well, companies - are operating in this manner=
. Let=E2=80=99s take the case of the Product Analytics team being concentra=
ted in Israel. That sort of homogeneity can be advantageous, in that they n=
aturally share a similar communication style and other unspoken social code=
. But there's also a risk that they=E2=80=99d be culturally disengaged from=
 the rest of the company. I=E2=80=99m curious about your thoughts on balanc=
ing inclusivity and the needs of the company in a modern, distributed data =
team, especially when these things don=E2=80=99t always align. It=E2=80=99s=
 an interesting question, because in reality, we=E2=80=99re mostly remote, =
and that dilutes the gravity of inclusiveness compared to when everyone is =
in the office. For example, companies used to worry about how people invite=
 their colleagues to lunch, but that=E2=80=99s not an issue when social int=
eractions are limited to a screen. Nevertheless, I do think there are ways =
to be inclusive even in an all-remote setup. I mentioned earlier that reorg=
s are sometimes implemented in a top-down manner, without accounting for pe=
ople=E2=80=99s individual preferences. I want to highlight that before I le=
ft Vimeo, one of the progressive changes that the new VP of Data is trying =
to implement is to account for not only people=E2=80=99s strengths and skil=
l sets, but also their personalities when evaluating role changes. =E2=80=
=9CData teams will function increasingly like product teams=E2=80=A6and if =
you consider the personality of successful product managers, they=E2=80=99r=
e typically people who have a knack for negotiation, orchestration, and thi=
nking about how pieces fit together in a larger system.=E2=80=9D To give an=
 example, some people have no issues dealing with really difficult stakehol=
ders, while there are others who dislike the occasionally confrontational n=
ature of stakeholder management, but they make fantastic individual, techni=
cal specialists. I=E2=80=99d try to align people=E2=80=99s personalities wi=
th the direction that they want to grow in to. If someone aspires to go dow=
n the managerial path, they=E2=80=99d need to excel at getting buy-in, bein=
g diplomatic, demonstrating a bit of political correctness at the right tim=
e, and all these other social-savvy traits. On the contrary, if you put som=
eone who doesn=E2=80=99t have the appetite for all these things into a lead=
ership position, it might significantly limit the team=E2=80=99s impact on =
the wider organization. So I do think it=E2=80=99s important to think about=
 these things. That=E2=80=99s fascinating. I don=E2=80=99t think I=E2=80=99=
ve ever heard someone explain the dilemma of placing the right people in an=
alytics leadership so lucidly, even though I reckon it=E2=80=99s actually a=
 pretty common problem in companies. Right, when you reach a senior level, =
regardless of what team you=E2=80=99re leading - even if it=E2=80=99s a tec=
hnical one - a large part of your work still boils down to people dynamics.=
 A good analytics leader would be able to intuit the ideal role or place fo=
r each person in their org, and that=E2=80=99s critical; if you can put som=
eone on a track where they feel genuinely motivated, they=E2=80=99ll go muc=
h further than someone who=E2=80=99s really technically skilled, but isn=E2=
=80=99t motivated in their role. A good analytics leader should also be abl=
e to effectively explain - and market to other teams - the value of the tea=
m=E2=80=99s work, which can have a huge impact on the analysts=E2=80=99 mor=
ale. I=E2=80=99ve worked in three or four companies now and saw firsthand h=
ow the Head of Analytics influences how well the data team is regarded with=
in the company. I=E2=80=99ve always thought that one of the conundrums that=
 analytics people face, is that there are far fewer options for us at the m=
id-career stage. For software engineers - especially really brilliant ones =
- their career development pathway is basically limitless. At the largest t=
ech companies, you can literally ascend the rank of a Level 10 engineer, an=
d earn over a million a year. But analysts don=E2=80=99t have such luxuries=
. Their pathway typically hits a =E2=80=9CPrincipal Data Analyst=E2=80=9D c=
eiling even in big organizations. From that point onwards, the analyst has =
to choose whether they want to pivot into an adjacent function, or go into =
people management which, for better or for worse, many people simply do not=
 have the temperament for. I also think that with the way the analytics ind=
ustry is moving - with AI taking over more and more of the low-level, manua=
l work that used to be done by data analysts - soft skills will be increasi=
ngly valuable. For instance, I think data teams will function increasingly =
like product teams; you=E2=80=99ve probably heard of the phrase, =E2=80=9Ct=
reat data as a product=E2=80=9D. And if you consider the personality of suc=
cessful product managers, they=E2=80=99re typically people who have a knack=
 for negotiation, orchestration, and thinking about how pieces fit together=
 in a larger system. The Evolution of Data Roles Speaking of evolutions, yo=
u=E2=80=99ve been in this industry for a decade. What are some of the bigge=
st changes that you=E2=80=99ve observed in the last 10 years, and how do yo=
u think they=E2=80=99ll continue changing? I think one of the biggest chang=
es that have happened in the last decade, is that the boundaries between al=
l the classic data roles have blurred. Even though people outside of the in=
dustry might ask, =E2=80=9CWhat=E2=80=99s the difference between a data ana=
lyst, data scientist, and data engineer?=E2=80=9D Internally, we knew there=
 was a distinction between the roles; the data analysts did the reporting w=
ork, the data scientists worked on sexy data models, and the data engineers=
 supplied the data to both groups. But instead of being three different col=
ors, now it looks like a gradient. Tools like dbt have birthed the engineer=
-analyst hybrid, while data analysts are increasingly valued for their abil=
ity to move upstream as well as downstream in the data creation process. I=
=E2=80=99m also a fan of the data product manager concept. If you treat a c=
ollection of dashboards as a product, then you can think of a data product =
manager as someone who=E2=80=99s building an ecosystem. A data PM has to un=
derstand how everything that happens on the business side connects to every=
thing that happens on the data side. This requires a holistic perspective, =
as opposed to a traditional data analyst who merely focused on making some =
graphs in a myopic fashion, and was limited to Excel, SQL, and some visuali=
zation software. And I actually think that this is a good thing. A lot of p=
eople are scared that AI will take data analyst jobs away, but what I think=
 will actually happen, is that AI will just take away the bottom layer of m=
ind-numbing querying and manual dashboarding work, and allow people to focu=
s on higher value work, such as thinking about the overarching design of th=
eir data architecture and ecosystem. I think you hit the nail on the dot ab=
out data analysts being increasingly valued for their ability to move upstr=
eam. In fact, I think the bar keeps getting so much higher every year. Busi=
ness analysts are the new data analysts. Data analysts are the new analytic=
s engineers. Data engineers are the new platform software engineers=E2=80=
=A6 Yeah, it=E2=80=99s going to be really interesting to see how the analyt=
ics industry evolves in the next few years. But I actually believe that eve=
n with the rapid adoption of new AI technologies, the analytics industry wi=
ll largely look the same five years from now. It will always take a bit of =
time to migrate data assets and get a large number of people to adopt new t=
ools effectively. =E2=80=9CA lot of people are scared that AI will take dat=
a analyst jobs away, but what I think will actually happen, is that AI will=
 just take away the bottom layer of mind-numbing querying and manual dashbo=
arding work, and allow people to focus on higher value work=E2=80=A6=E2=80=
=9D And at the end of the day, we=E2=80=99ll still need humans to tackle so=
me manual work such as data cleaning, because that requires a semantic unde=
rstanding that AI can never perform. I think you hit the nail on the dot ab=
out data analysts being increasingly valued for their ability to move upstr=
eam. In fact, I think the bar keeps getting so much higher every year. Busi=
ness analysts are the new data analysts. Data analysts are the new analytic=
s engineers. Data engineers are the new platform software engineers=E2=80=
=A6 Exactly. Another role that I=E2=80=99ve seen emerge in recent years is =
the Fractional CDO - a Chief Data Officer who only works on a part-time bas=
is. Yeah, it=E2=80=99s now possible to have a plug-and-chug data team where=
 you have an experienced data practitioner who sets up the data warehouse, =
data pipelines, and dashboards. And if they=E2=80=99re done in a sustainabl=
e and scalable fashion, technically that person only needs to show up occas=
ionally for fine-tuning and maintenance, right? Yep. Christine, I=E2=80=99m=
 so glad we had this conversation. It=E2=80=99s been a fun and eye-opening =
one for me. Likewise, thanks again for having me! What do you think of the =
