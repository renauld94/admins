Hi Simon,
cc Mia

We will fast track it this Monday.

Have a good weekend
Lucas

================================================================================

LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE:
1. **Payment Confirmation:** Lucas Kacem, as founder of Digital Unicorn Services Co., Ltd., 
   explicitly confirmed that the September payment would be "fast-tracked" on Monday 
   (following October 10).

2. **Timeline:**
   - October 9: Simon requested payment confirmation for September hours
   - October 10, 4:46 PM: Lucas promised to "fast track it this Monday"
   - October 13: Payment still not received; Simon follows up
   - October 16: Bryan Truong claims no payment is warranted (contradicts Lucas's promise)
   - October 22: Formal termination notice sent (further contradiction)

3. **Contractual Breach:** 
   - Article 3 of Contract 0925/CONSULT/DU requires payment for services rendered
   - Lucas's promise to "fast-track" on Monday constitutes founder-level acknowledgment 
     of payment obligation
   - Failure to deliver this promised payment constitutes material breach

4. **Admission of Liability:**
   - Lucas's willingness to fast-track suggests he recognized the debt was valid
   - The contradiction between Lucas's promise and Bryan's later denial shows inconsistency 
     and potential coordination to avoid payment
