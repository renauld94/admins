### ⏰ STEP 2: Send "Final Reminder Before Legal Action" (16:45–17:45 VN time today)

**Subject Line:**
```
Final Reminder – Unauthorized Use of Image & Outstanding Settlement – Legal Action Pending
```

**Body (keep factual, avoid emotional language):**

```
Dear Mr. Lucas,

As of today, Friday 7 November 2025, 17:30 Vietnam time, no confirmation or payment 
has been received regarding my previous formal notices dated 29 October and 4–5 November 2025.

Current outstanding matters:

1. Unauthorized use of my personal image on the Digital Unicorn France website 
   (https://digitalunicorn.fr/a-propos/) remains visible as of today.
   Demand: Immediate removal + written confirmation by 18:00 VN time today.

2. Outstanding consulting fees under Contract No. 0925/CONSULT/DU remain unpaid.
   Demand: Full payment (€8,000) within three working days (by 10 November 2025).

The Company's failure to respond to multiple formal notices constitutes continued breach 
of Articles 32, 351, 357, 428, and 592 of the Vietnamese Civil Code (2015).

Unless written confirmation of:
   • Image removal and written proof of removal, AND
   • Settlement arrangement for outstanding fees

...is received by 18:00 Vietnam time today, I will proceed next week—without further notice—with:

   A. Formal complaint to CNIL (French Data Protection Authority) 
      regarding unauthorized personal data processing and image use;
   
   B. Civil claim before the competent Vietnamese People's Court 
      for debt recovery, statutory interest, and damages;
   
   C. Complaint to DoLISA and relevant Vietnamese labour authorities;
   
   D. Formal notice to your French hosting provider and domain registrar 
      citing GDPR Article 17 (right to erasure) violations.

Please confirm receipt and advise payment/removal status immediately.

Kind regards,
Simon Renauld

## Notes & Strategy

✅ **Why this approach works:**
1. CNIL complaint is free and carries government weight in France.
2. Vietnam lawyer letter adds formal pressure without committing to court costs.
3. Dual jurisdiction (France + Vietnam) makes ignoring you legally costly.
4. Archive proof is independent, timestamped, and courts accept it globally.
5. Settlement window remains open if they panic after legal notices arrive.

⚠️ **Risk mitigation:**
- All correspondence is factual and references specific laws (no threats or emotional language).
- Evidence is secured before they can alter/remove it.
- You have a paper trail showing good-faith attempts to settle before escalation.
- Vietnamese people's court is typically faster/cheaper than EU litigation.
