Dear Board of Directors,

As of today, October 9 (standard DU pay date), I have not received payment
or written confirmation for my September hours under Consultant Contract
0925/CONSULT/DU.

This constitutes a third breach of the agreed payment terms. Unless payment
is confirmed by *12:00 PM (Vietnam time) tomorrow, October 10*, I will
proceed to escalate the matter to ensure compliance and record accuracy, as
I remain listed as active within ICON and J&J systems.

Best regards,
Simon Renauld
