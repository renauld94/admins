1. **sn.renauld@gmail.com** - Personal/Active account
2. **simon.renauld@digitalunicorn.fr** - Company account (DEACTIVATED as of ~Oct 29)

## 🔍 CRITICAL: Two-Account Search Strategy

### Account 1: sn.renauld@gmail.com (Active - PRIMARY EVIDENCE SOURCE)

**Why This Account Matters:**
- Your personal/active Gmail account
- Likely contains ALL correspondence as external recipient
- Contains bounced email from Oct 29 proving deactivation
- Will have sent items from your side
- **This is your primary evidence source**

### Account 2: simon.renauld@digitalunicorn.fr (DEACTIVATED)

**Status:** Account deactivated on or before October 29, 2025

**Critical Evidence:**
- **October 29 bounce notification** proves deactivation
- Shows company prevented your contractual response
- May still be accessible through:
  - Email forwarding (if set up)
  - Email client backup (Thunderbird, Outlook)
  - Mobile device cache
  - Archive/export if done before deactivation

**⚠️ WARNING:** If you can still access this account, DOWNLOAD EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY before complete deletion.

## ⚠️ What If Emails Are Missing?

### Possible Reasons:
1. **Wrong account:** Check if correspondence went to different email
