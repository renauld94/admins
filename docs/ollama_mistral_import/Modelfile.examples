# Modelfile examples for importing models/adapters into Ollama

# 1) Import a single GGUF model file (place Modelfile in same directory as the .gguf file)
FROM /path/to/file.gguf

# 2) Import a directory containing Safetensors weights (point FROM at the directory)
FROM /path/to/safetensors/directory

# 3) Create a model from an Ollama-base model + an adapter (safetensors/gguf adapter)
#    Use the same base model that the adapter was trained against.
FROM <base-model-name>
ADAPTER /path/to/adapter/file.safetensors

# 4) Minimal Modelfile when the weights are in the current directory:
FROM .

# Notes:
# - Put the Modelfile in the same directory as the weights (or reference the absolute path).
# - Ollama will read the Modelfile and build the model with `ollama create <name>`.
