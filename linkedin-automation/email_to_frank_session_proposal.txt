Subject: Thank you + Session proposal for QA & QC Manager role

Hi Frank,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me and discuss the QA & QC Manager opportunity at ADA. I really enjoyed our conversation and learning more about the new data platform you're building.

I've been thinking about our discussion, and I'm very excited about the opportunity to build quality assurance from scratch. The challenge of ensuring 100% data accuracy across multiple data sources (TikTok, Shopee, Lazada, Amazon) is exactly the kind of problem I love solving.

**What resonates with me:**
- Building QA infrastructure from day one for a new platform (rare opportunity!)
- Working directly with the development team (embedded QA approach)
- Implementing automated testing with Airflow and pytest (my exact tech stack)
- Ensuring data accuracy at enterprise scale (I've done this with 500M+ healthcare records)

**What I bring:**
- Software engineering background (I can read code and enhance logs, not just test)
- Proven automated test pipeline experience (Airflow DAGs, pytest, CI/CD)
- Data platform QA expertise (Moodle, healthcare analytics, infrastructure automation)
- Quality-first mindset (build quality in from the start, don't inspect it in later)

**Proposed next step:**

I'd love to schedule a follow-up session when you're available to discuss:

1. **Your current QA challenges** - What are the biggest pain points with data accuracy today?
2. **My approach** - I can walk you through how I'd implement the QA framework for ADA's platform
3. **Concrete examples** - I can share real test plans, automation code, and metrics dashboards from my previous work

I've prepared some materials that demonstrate my approach:
- Sample test plan (working Python/pytest code for data validation)
- QA philosophy & methodology (including a case study: 99.92% accuracy on 500M records)
- Metrics dashboard mockup (what I'd build for real-time quality monitoring)

I can share these during our session or send them beforehand - whatever works best for you.

**Availability:**
I'm flexible and can work around your schedule. Here are some times that work well for me, but I'm happy to adjust:

- **This week (Nov 5-8):**
  - Wednesday Nov 6: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM (your timezone)
  - Thursday Nov 7: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
  - Friday Nov 8: 9:00 AM - 3:00 PM

- **Next week (Nov 11-15):**
  - Monday-Friday: Generally flexible, just let me know what works

The session could be 30-60 minutes depending on what you'd like to cover. We can do it via Zoom, Google Meet, or whatever platform you prefer.

Let me know what works for your schedule, and I'll send over a calendar invite!

Looking forward to continuing our conversation.

Best regards,
Simon
