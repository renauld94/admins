# Enterprise Data Science Lab – Case Study

**Project Duration**: March 2024 – Present  
**Role**: Lead Architect & Implementation  
**Location**: Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam

## Executive Summary

Designed and deployed a low-cost, enterprise-grade data science infrastructure using open-source technologies and virtualization to support real-time analytics, distributed computing, and machine learning operations at scale.

## Challenge

Build a scalable, high-performance data platform capable of supporting:
- Real-time analytics and distributed data processing
- Collaborative data science workflows
- AI/ML model development and deployment
- Secure, encrypted storage with compliance requirements
- Cost-effective operation without cloud vendor lock-in

## Solution Architecture

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Virtualization**: Proxmox VE for high-availability and failover
- **Distributed Computing**: Hadoop, Apache Spark, Kafka for real-time processing
- **Storage**: Encrypted, scalable architecture aligned to privacy regulations
- **Networking**: Secure, multi-tenant environment

### Analytics & AI Layer
- **Collaborative Workspaces**: JupyterHub and Anaconda for data science teams
- **Machine Learning**: Custom LLMs, open-source ML pipelines
- **MLOps**: Model versioning, monitoring, and deployment automation
- **Visualization**: AI-driven CRM dashboards

### Automation & Integration
- **Data Pipelines**: Automated ETL/ELT workflows
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance and resource tracking
- **API Integration**: RESTful services for external systems

## Key Outcomes

### Performance
- **2x reduction** in manual reporting through AI-driven dashboards
- **Real-time analytics** capability with sub-second query response
- **High availability** with automated failover and disaster recovery

### Cost Efficiency
- **~70% cost savings** vs. equivalent cloud infrastructure
- **Zero vendor lock-in** using open-source stack
- **Scalable architecture** supporting 3x growth without major refactoring

### Technical Impact
- Improved client tracking accuracy through ML-powered monitoring
- Enabled collaborative data science across distributed teams
- Established secure, compliant data storage framework
- Built foundation for advanced AI/ML experimentation

## Technology Stack

**Infrastructure**: Proxmox VE, Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)  
**Distributed Computing**: Hadoop HDFS, Apache Spark, Kafka  
**Data Science**: JupyterHub, Anaconda, Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)  
**MLOps**: Model registry, versioning, monitoring tools  
**Storage**: Encrypted file systems, backup automation  
**Monitoring**: Grafana, Prometheus, custom dashboards  
**Security**: Network segmentation, encryption at rest/transit, access controls

## Lessons Learned

1. **Open-source first**: Avoided vendor lock-in while maintaining enterprise-grade capabilities
2. **Modular design**: Each component (compute, storage, ML) scales independently
3. **Automation critical**: Reduced operational overhead by automating deployment and monitoring
4. **Security by design**: Built compliance and privacy controls from day one

## Applications

- Real-time business intelligence and reporting
- Customer behavior analytics and segmentation
- Predictive modeling and forecasting
- AI-powered automation and decision support
- Large-scale data processing and transformation

## Future Roadmap

- Expand distributed computing cluster capacity
- Integrate advanced AI models (GPT-based agents, computer vision)
- Build self-service analytics portal for business users
- Implement advanced anomaly detection and alerting
