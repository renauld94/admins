## About

Canadian-born analytics and data engineering leader based in Ho Chi Minh City with 10+ years across Southeast Asia and Latin America. I specialize in building scalable data platforms, automating core processes (reducing manual workloads by 80%), and leading cross-functional teams to deliver analytics projects 30% faster. My experience spans healthcare and high-growth startups, where I've architected enterprise ETL and data warehousing to support 3x user growth, migrated systems to improve data quality by 50%, and built Python automation that saved ~$150K annually.

I'm comfortable operating across the full data stack—from modeling and pipelines to analytics, governance, and platform engineering—using Python, SQL, PySpark, Power BI, and cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, Hetzner). I've led teams of 50+ professionals, delivered KPI dashboards that supported double-digit growth, designed technical training curricula (Python, PySpark, Databricks, Git), and implemented governance frameworks that strengthened accuracy, compliance, and scalability.

I'm motivated by practical impact, collaborative execution, and continuous improvement. My goal is to help organizations turn data into reliable, secure, and actionable systems that scale with the business.

Core tools: Python, SQL, ETL/ELT, PySpark, Power BI, Redshift/PostgreSQL/MySQL, Databricks, Git/GitHub Actions, CloudWatch, Grafana.
