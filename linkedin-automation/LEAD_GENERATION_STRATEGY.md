## 🎯 STRATEGY: Turn Infrastructure Into Leads

### **Phase 1: Showcase Your Capabilities (Week 1-2)**

#### 1. **Create "Behind the Scenes" Content Series**

**LinkedIn Posts** (Use your automation!):

**Post 1: "My $100/Month AI Lab That Beats AWS"**
```
Most companies spend $5K-10K/month on cloud AI infrastructure.

I run the same workload on a $100/month homelab:
• 20+ AI agents on Proxmox
• Private LLMs (Ollama on VM 159)
• 49GB RAM, 8 vCPU dedicated to AI
• Zero vendor lock-in, 100% data privacy

Here's the architecture [diagram]

Why this matters for your business:
→ 98% cost savings for ML experimentation
→ HIPAA-compliant (data never leaves your network)
→ Unlimited experiments on fixed budget

```

**Post 2: "I Automated My LinkedIn Company Page in 4 Hours"**
```
Most marketing teams spend 10+ hours/week on social media.

I built a complete automation suite in one afternoon:
• Content generation (Python)
• Browser automation (Playwright)
• Post scheduling (Mon/Wed/Fri)
• Analytics tracking
• Weekly reports

Stack: Python, Playwright, Ollama AI agents

Result: 3 professional posts/week, zero manual work

This is what data engineering looks like in 2025.

#Automation #DataEngineering #Productivity
```

**Post 3: "From Moodle to Production: Teaching While Building"**
```
I run a full Python Academy on my homelab while consulting full-time.

Infrastructure:
• Moodle LMS (VM 9001, 8GB RAM)
• 50+ enrolled students
• Grafana monitoring
• Postgres + Redis stack
• Zero downtime in 6 months

This proves a principle I teach my students:

"If you can't deploy it yourself, you don't understand it."

Real learning happens when you manage production systems.

Curriculum: ETL, Data Warehousing, ML Pipelines, DevOps

#DataEngineering #Education #Python
```

#### 2. **Create Interactive Demos**

**Option A: Public API Showcase**
Expose select endpoints from your VM 159 agents:

```python
# Add to portfolio_agent.py
@app.get('/public/demo/health')
def public_demo_health():
    """Public demo: Show infrastructure health without auth"""
    return {
        'proxmox_vms': 4,
        'ai_agents': 20,
        'uptime': '99.9%',
        'architecture': 'Proxmox + Ollama + FastAPI',
        'data_processed_mtd': '1.2TB',
        'demo': 'https://www.simondatalab.de/demo'
    }
```

**Option B: Live Architecture Diagram**
- Use your existing infrastructure visualizations
- Host on portfolio site
- Make it interactive (click VM → see specs)
- Add "Book a Demo" CTA

#### 3. **Create Lead Magnets**

**Free Resources to Capture Emails:**

**A) "The $100/Month AI Lab Blueprint"** (PDF)
- Your exact Proxmox setup
- Ollama configuration
- Cost breakdown
- Hardware recommendations
- **CTA**: "Want help building this? Book a consultation"

**B) "Healthcare Analytics Compliance Checklist"** (Google Sheet)
- HIPAA requirements
- Data lineage tracking
- Audit trail setup
- **CTA**: "Need compliance automation? Let's talk"

**C) "Data Engineering Homelab Course"** (Free Moodle enrollment)
- 3 lessons from your Python Academy
- Showcases your teaching skills
- **CTA**: "Hire me to train your team"

Host these on portfolio site with email capture form.
