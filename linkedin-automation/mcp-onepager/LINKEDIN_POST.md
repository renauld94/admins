## Post Text

**From prompts to production—with Model Context Protocol**

MCP turns your IDE into a command center for real infrastructure.

**What it is:**
A universal contract that exposes tools, data, and actions to AI agents—securely and repeatably.

**What you can do:**

🖥️ **Proxmox automation**
→ Deploy VMs, manage containers, monitor resources—all from VS Code

🤖 **VS Code agents**
→ Refactor code, generate tests, update docs—with full project context

🔌 **Connect anything**
→ Databases, APIs, cloud services—one protocol, infinite capabilities

**Why it matters:**
- Explicit, auditable actions (no surprises)
- Works with any MCP-aware client
- Built for regulated, production environments

No vendor lock-in. No brittle scripts. Just clean automation that scales.
