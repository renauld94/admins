I build data platforms that work—reliably, at scale, and with quality baked in from day one.

Over 10+ years, I've led teams of 50+ data engineers and analysts to deliver systems processing 500M+ healthcare records monthly with 99.9% reliability while maintaining 100% HIPAA compliance. My sweet spot is the intersection of data engineering and quality assurance: building pipelines that don't just move data, but validate, monitor, and self-correct.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 WHAT I BRING TO THE TABLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

▸ DATA ENGINEERING AT SCALE
Built enterprise ETL/ELT pipelines using Python, PySpark, Airflow, and Kafka. Supported 3x user growth without infrastructure hiccups. Automated 80% of manual data operations, saving $150K annually.

▸ QUALITY & TESTING MINDSET
Implemented comprehensive test automation (pytest, Great Expectations), CI/CD for data pipelines, and ML-powered anomaly detection that caught issues before they reached production. Improved data quality from 70% to 95%.

▸ COMPLIANCE & GOVERNANCE
Achieved 100% HIPAA compliance and built GDPR-ready systems. Established data lineage, role-based access controls, and audit trails that satisfied both internal stakeholders and regulators.

▸ TEAM LEADERSHIP
Led cross-functional teams (data engineers, data scientists, analysts) to deliver projects 30% faster. Mentored 3 team members into leadership roles. Fostered collaborative culture that improved retention.
