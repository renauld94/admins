# LinkedIn Carousel Post - AI Homelab

## Post Copy (Professional, No Emojis)

Just completed an AI-native upgrade of my homelab infrastructure using the Model Context Protocol.

Traditional infrastructure management meant manual VM provisioning taking 30+ minutes, constant SSH sessions for routine tasks, and purely reactive troubleshooting. I wanted a better way.

The solution: ProxmoxMCP paired with intelligent agents that manage nodes, VMs, storage, and commands through scoped API tokens. The results speak for themselves.

CI/CD now spins up ephemeral test environments for each pull request and tears them down automatically when complete. ML training workloads run on demand with GPU VMs that start only when needed and shut down on completion. Automated health checks handle most incidents before I even notice them.

Measurable outcomes: VM provisioning dropped to under 2 minutes, SSH sessions reduced by 50%, infrastructure overhead down 20%, and incident response times averaging 5 minutes from alert to resolution.

The technology stack combines Proxmox VE with Cloudflare Tunnel for resilient routing, OpenWebUI and Ollama for stable AI access, and MLflow with Grafana for observability. Security includes encryption at rest and in transit, comprehensive audit logging, and least-privilege roles.

If you're exploring AI-driven infrastructure, this approach delivers simpler, safer, and measurably faster operations.

## Alternative Shorter Version

Just turned my Proxmox homelab into an AI-native environment using the Model Context Protocol.

Key improvements:
- Agents manage infrastructure via ProxmoxMCP server with scoped API tokens
- Automated CI/CD provisions test VMs per PR and destroys them after completion
- ML workloads run on-demand GPU VMs that shut down automatically
- Self-healing operations with automated health monitoring

Results: VM provisioning under 2 minutes, 50% fewer manual interventions, 20% lower power costs, 5-minute average incident response.

Built on Proxmox VE, Cloudflare Tunnel, OpenWebUI/Ollama, with encryption, audit logging, and least-privilege security.

For anyone exploring AI-driven infrastructure, this approach makes operations simpler, safer, and faster.
