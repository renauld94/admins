Subject: Thank you for the ADA introduction!

Hi David,

I wanted to reach out and say thank you for introducing me to Frank Plazanet at ADA. That introduction opened the door to an exciting opportunity!

I had a great conversation with Frank about the QA & QC Manager role, and I'm really excited about the possibility of building ADA's quality assurance infrastructure from the ground up. The challenge of ensuring data accuracy across TikTok, Shopee, Lazada, and Amazon aligns perfectly with my experience in automated testing and data platform QA.

I truly appreciate you taking the time to make that connection. It means a lot when someone in your network goes out of their way to help.

Beyond this opportunity, I'd love to stay in touch! Your work at ADA sounds fascinating, and I'm always interested in chatting about data quality challenges, testing automation, or just hearing about what you're working on.

If you're ever free for a coffee (virtual or in person), I'd enjoy catching up.

Thanks again, David!

Best regards,
Simon
