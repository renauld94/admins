Subject: Thank you - Excited about QA & QC Manager opportunity

Hi Frank,

Thank you for taking the time to discuss the QA & QC Manager role today. It was great meeting you and learning more about ADA's new data platform.

I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to build quality assurance from the ground up. The challenge of ensuring 100% accuracy across TikTok, Shopee, Lazada, and Amazon data sources aligns perfectly with my experience implementing automated test pipelines for critical data systems.

A few things that stood out from our conversation:

**What excites me most:**
- Building QA infrastructure from scratch for a new platform (rare opportunity!)
- Working directly with the development team (embedded QA is how I work best)
- Implementing automated testing with Airflow and pytest (my exact tech stack)
- Ensuring data accuracy for enterprise clients (I've done this at scale with 500M+ healthcare records)

**What I bring:**
- Software engineering background (I can read code, not just test it)
- Proven experience with automated test pipelines (Airflow DAGs, pytest, CI/CD)
- Data platform QA expertise (Moodle, healthcare analytics, ProxmoxMCP)
- Quality-first mindset (build it in, don't inspect it in)

I've been thinking about how we could measure success in this role and wanted to share some initial ideas. I'll send a follow-up email in the next day or two with a proposed QA metrics framework - nothing formal, just my thoughts on how we could ensure 99.9% accuracy while keeping the process maintainable.

In the meantime, if there's anything else you need from me (portfolio examples, technical writing samples, references), please don't hesitate to ask.

Looking forward to next steps!

Best regards,  
Simon
