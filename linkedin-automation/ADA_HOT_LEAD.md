### Role Overview
Ensure 100% data accuracy for ADA's data platform by implementing enterprise-grade quality control and automation.

**Key Responsibilities**:
1. Quality Assurance - Design/execute framework for data accuracy (manual + automated)
2. Quality Control - Ongoing monitoring, audits, reviews
3. Automation - Implement tools/scripts for data retrieval & validation
4. Collaboration - Work directly with developer team
5. Documentation - Maintain QC processes, test plans

**Why You're Building New Platform**:
- New version of data platform being built
- Opportunity to implement best practices from day 1
- Direct communication with dev team
- Shape QA processes from the beginning

### Required Skills ✅ YOU HAVE ALL
- [x] PostgreSQL ✓
- [x] SQL ✓
- [x] Automated Testing ✓
- [x] Quality Control (5-10 years) ✓

2. **Automated Test Pipelines** (ProxmoxMCP, Airflow, MLOps)
3. **Data Platform Experience** (Moodle, Healthcare Analytics)
4. **Critical Data QA** (Healthcare = 100% accuracy required)
5. **End-to-end understanding** (Can read code + enhance logs)

## 🎯 Prepare for Frank Session

### Talking Points

#### 1. Automated Test Pipelines **(KEY DIFFERENTIATOR)**
"At my previous role, I implemented full CI/CD pipelines with automated testing using:
- Airflow DAGs for data pipeline orchestration
- pytest for unit/integration testing
- GitHub Workflows for automated test execution
- Automated data validation on 500M+ healthcare records"

**Why this matters**: Most QA managers come from manual testing. You can BUILD the automation from scratch.

#### 2. Software Engineering Background **(UNIQUE VALUE)**
"Unlike traditional QA managers, I come from software engineering. This means:
- I can READ the code (not just test it)
- I can ENHANCE software logs (not just read them)
- I understand developer mindset (better collaboration)
- I can identify issues at the code level (proactive QA)"

**Why this matters**: Job listing says "Experience as Software Engineer is a plus" - YOU HAVE IT!

#### 3. Data Platform Experience
"I've built and maintained data platforms with critical accuracy requirements:
- **Moodle Platform** (moodle.simondatalab.de): Course data, student enrollments, progress tracking
- **Healthcare Analytics**: 500M+ records, HIPAA compliance (99.9% accuracy required)
- **ProxmoxMCP**: Infrastructure automation with data pipeline QA"

**Why this matters**: You understand the full data lifecycle, not just testing.

#### 4. Quality from Day 1
"I've built systems from scratch where quality was embedded from the beginning:
- Implemented QA frameworks for new platforms
- Designed test strategies before code was written
- Built monitoring and alerting for data accuracy
- Created documentation standards for transparency"

**Why this matters**: They're building NEW version of platform - you can do this!

### Questions to Ask Frank

1. **Team Structure**: "You mentioned building a new platform version. What's the current team structure, and where would QA fit in?"

2. **Automation State**: "What's the current state of test automation? Are you starting from scratch or enhancing existing frameworks?"

3. **Data Sources**: "The job mentions TikTok, Shopee, Lazada, Amazon. Are there specific data quality challenges with each platform?"

4. **Success Metrics**: "How do you measure data accuracy today? What would success look like in this role after 6 months?"

5. **Technology Stack**: "Besides PostgreSQL and Airflow, what other technologies does the platform use?"

### What NOT to Say

❌ "I'm learning Airflow" (You already USE it!)  
❌ "I've only done manual testing" (You automate!)  
❌ "I'm transitioning to QA" (You're bringing engineering to QA!)  

### What TO Say

✅ "I've implemented automated test pipelines with Airflow and pytest"  
✅ "My software engineering background helps me proactively prevent bugs"  
✅ "I've ensured data accuracy on 500M+ healthcare records"  
✅ "I can build the QA framework from scratch for your new platform"
