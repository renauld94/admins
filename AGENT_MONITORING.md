> This monitoring documentation has been consolidated and reorganized.

For the active, consolidated agent documentation please see:

- `docs/agents/README.md` — consolidated index and navigation for agents, monitoring, and model setup.
- `PHASE_1_2_3_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` — migration & config update summary (repo root).
- `WORKSPACE_AGENT_ANALYSIS_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` — full audit & recommendations (repo root).

Archived original content has been preserved under `docs/archived/AGENT_MONITORING.md`.

If you want the original full content restored to the root or merged into a single long-form reference (`docs/agents/AGENTS_REFERENCE.md`), tell me and I will merge the archived files into one curated document.
