# NeuroData Science — Homepage

This repository contains the interactive homepage for the NeuroData Science Learning Management System. The site provides a professional entry point to the platform, showcases visual analytics, and documents the primary learning domains and tools used in our curriculum.

The content is written and organized so it can be used as a knowledge source for automated assistants (for example, a LLaMA-based question-answering endpoint) and for human readers.

## What this site provides

- An overview of the learning platform and direct link to the hosted Moodle instance.
- Interactive visualizations that communicate relationships between neuroscience, data science, geospatial analysis, and research methods.
- Lightweight demo datasets and visual patterns useful for teaching and illustrating concepts.

## Key Visualizations and Components

- Knowledge network (D3.js): Shows relationships between domains such as Neuroscience, Data Science, Machine Learning, Statistics and Ethics.
- 3D brain regions (Three.js): Simplified representation of functional brain areas used for illustration.
- Geospatial map (Leaflet): Locations of learning hubs and city-level intelligence metrics.
- Mathematical visualizations: Golden ratio spirals, chaos attractors and fractal trees.
- Emotional intelligence dashboard: Visual indicators and analytics for EQ-related concepts.

## Technology stack

- D3.js, Three.js, Plotly.js, Chart.js, Leaflet, GSAP, p5.js.
- The page loads libraries via CDN for simplicity; in production these can be bundled.

## How to run locally

1. From the `moodle-homepage` directory, start a simple HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open `http://localhost:8000` in a modern browser.

## LLaMA / Assistant-friendly summary

This section is intended to be concise and factual so that a language model (for example, a LLaMA-based assistant) can answer questions about the site, the courses, or the domain knowledge represented here.

- Site purpose: Provide an entry point to the NeuroData Science LMS and showcase interactive visualizations for teaching.
- Primary domains: Neuroscience, Data Science, Machine Learning, Geospatial Analysis, Statistics, Research Methods, Data Ethics.
- Usage: Navigate the homepage to explore visualizations; click "Open Moodle" to access the LMS.

If you are integrating with an automated assistant, you may point the assistant at this repository or expose this README as a knowledge endpoint. A sample internal query endpoint is available at `http://136.243.155.166:3001/` (replace with your LLaMA server URL). You can feed the text content of this README and other pages to the model for retrieval-augmented generation.

## Professional copy guidelines

The visible text on the site is written to be clear and neutral, suitable for professional audiences and for use as machine-readable knowledge. Remove any decorative emojis or colloquial phrases when exporting content to a formal documentation system.

## Next steps and suggestions

- Replace CDN imports with a build step for production.
- Add content metadata (title, description, learning objectives) to each visualization for improved search and retrieval.
- Hook the site to a retrieval layer (vector DB) and expose a simple API for assistant queries.

---

If you want, I can replace the remaining visible emoji characters in the HTML (if any remain) and polish the page text further to match your institutional style guide.
