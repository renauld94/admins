> This setup guide has been consolidated and archived as part of a workspace re-organization.

For the active, consolidated agent & model documentation, see:

- `docs/agents/README.md` — consolidated index and guidance for model setup on VM 159 and Continue configuration.
- `PHASE_1_2_3_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` — migration & config update summary (repo root).

Archived original content has been preserved under `docs/archived/AGENTS_Ai.md`.

If you want me to merge the archived docs into a single long-form reference (`docs/agents/AGENTS_REFERENCE.md`) or to extract runnable runbooks (cron/systemd runbooks), say which one and I'll produce it.
