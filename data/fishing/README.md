Fishing data folder

This folder contains sample and downloaded datasets used for the Geospatial Fishing Dashboard.

Files and purpose
- manifest.json: catalog of recommended datasets, sources, and notes (generated by assistant)
- fishing_catch_by_province_vn.csv: small sample CSV (example schema)
- fishing_activity_vn.geojson: small sample GeoJSON with points

How to perform full API/portal pulls
1. Install dependencies and run the CKAN downloader (recommended for data.gov.vn and OpenDevelopment Mekong):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
python3 scripts/pull_open_datasets.py --download --out data/fishing
```

2. Global Fishing Watch (AIS / fishing effort):
- Global Fishing Watch requires registration and acceptance of terms to download bulk AIS-derived datasets.
- Preferred approach for large-scale queries: use the BigQuery public tables (see GFW docs) or register for dataset access.
- Example BigQuery: use `gcloud` or Python google-cloud-bigquery to query gfw tables and export Vietnam EEZ aggregates.

3. Protected areas (WDPA / ProtectedPlanet):
- WDPA often requires an account and license acceptance. Visit https://www.protectedplanet.net/ to request downloads.

4. Habitat layers (mangroves, seagrass):
- Global Mangrove Watch provides downloadable rasters/shapefiles at https://www.globalmangrovewatch.org/
- UNEP-WCMC / Ocean+ has habitat layers available via https://data.unep-wcmc.org/

Notes on preprocessing
- Keep all vector layers in EPSG:4326 (WGS84). The provided script will attempt conversion using geopandas if installed.
- For shapefile ZIPs: extract and convert to GeoJSON using geopandas or ogr2ogr.
- For large AIS data, avoid downloading raw AIS; instead use aggregated tiles or BigQuery extracts.

Licensing & ethics
- Always check each dataset's license in its metadata. Some datasets like GFW require attribution and terms acceptance.
- Avoid identifying or exposing private vessel/person data; aggregate where possible.

If you want, I can:
- Run the CKAN downloader here (if network permits) and fetch available Vietnam datasets.
- Prepare a BigQuery SQL example to extract Global Fishing Watch fishing-effort raster/tiles covering Vietnam's EEZ.
- Add a one-off ETL script that normalizes common fields into `id,name,province,lat,lon,category,year,metric,source_url`.
