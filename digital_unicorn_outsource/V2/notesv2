Hi Jake and Team,


I must raise a serious concern at this time.

 

Feedback from both Nicolas and David is that some of the material so far, looks to have been generate by AI with little review by Digital Unicorn. Items are missed and in the wrong sequence, and a natural-flow of training is not present. This impression must therefore be rectified immediately.

 

I understand that there is pressure to progress as soon as possible, but Digital Unicorn is charging a fee to provide expert-level Python knowledge alongside expert training-delivery experience.

 

The review process by J&J and ICON will not be to correct basic omission, sequencing errors, or any basic deficiency in materials. Digital Unicorn Python-expert(s) must review and correct materials before they are sent to J&J/ICON.

 

Please keep this in mind as we finalise Topics 2.1, 2.2 & 2.3, and as 2.4 to 2.7 are created across the coming week. As always, please reach out to David or I  if a meeting is useful to clarify any questions.

 

Kind regards,

Graham

Long Average Sentence Length: These files contain code blocks (Python/Jupyter), which create very long "sentences" when parsed as text. The detector sees this as AI-like formality.
Low Lexical Diversity: Code has repetitive keywords and structures, reducing unique word ratios.
High Syntactic Complexity: Dense punctuation and complex structures from code.
Low Burstiness: Consistent code formatting creates uniform sentence lengths.
Low Perplexity: Code is highly predictable, which the detector interprets as AI-like.
