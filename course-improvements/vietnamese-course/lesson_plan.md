Pedagogy & features to make it epic

- SRS flashcards: export generated vocab to Anki/GIFT for spaced review.
- Multimedia: short explainer videos (AI-generated scripts -> record or TTS), annotated subtitles, interactive transcripts.
- Gamification: weekly badges, streaks, leaderboard (Moodle completion + gradebook integration).
- Accessibility: transcripts for audio/video, image alt text, simple UI for low-bandwidth users.

Assessment & Rubrics

- Speaking rubric: Pronunciation (25%), Fluency (25%), Grammar (25%), Appropriacy (25%).

Next steps (technical)

1. Use the `ai_prompts.txt` to generate:
   - A bank of 200+ dialogue snippets, 500 vocab flashcards, and 40 short quizzes.
2. Import `quiz_topic1.gift` into Moodle to see question formatting.
3. Decide whether you want me to auto-generate all lesson content into GIFT/HTML/SCORM and prepare an upload script (I can do this using your local LLM endpoints).
