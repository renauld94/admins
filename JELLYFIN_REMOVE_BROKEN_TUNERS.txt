  JELLYFIN - REMOVE BROKEN TUNERS (HTTP 500 FIX)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM:
--------
These tuners reference files that DON'T EXIST:
❌ UK Channels      → /config/data/playlists/clean/UK_channels.m3u
❌ US Channels      → /config/data/playlists/clean/US_channels.m3u
❌ French Channels  → /config/data/playlists/clean/FR_channels.m3u
❌ German Channels  → /config/data/playlists/clean/DE_channels.m3u
❌ Canadian Channels → /config/data/playlists/clean/CA_channels.m3u

Result: HTTP 500 errors when Jellyfin tries to load them


FIX: DELETE THE BROKEN TUNERS
------------------------------

1. Go to: https://jellyfin.simondatalab.de/web/index.html

2. Navigate: Dashboard → Live TV → Tuner Devices

3. You should see 6 tuners total:
   ✅ KEEP: https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/index.m3u (WORKING)
   ❌ DELETE: UK Channels (broken)
   ❌ DELETE: US Channels (broken)
   ❌ DELETE: French Channels (broken)
   ❌ DELETE: German Channels (broken)
   ❌ DELETE: Canadian Channels (broken)

4. Click the ⋮ (three dots) menu next to each broken tuner

5. Select "Delete" for each one

6. After deleting all 5 broken tuners, ONLY the working IPTV-Org 
   tuner should remain


VERIFICATION:
-------------
After deletion:
1. Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+R
2. Check Dashboard → Live TV
3. HTTP 500 errors should be gone
4. scrollTo JavaScript errors should be gone
5. Channels should load and play


ALTERNATIVE: ADD REGIONAL TUNERS (OPTIONAL)
-------------------------------------------
If you want regional channels, use these WORKING URLs instead:

UK:     https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/uk.m3u
US:     https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/us.m3u
France: https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/fr.m3u
Germany: https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/de.m3u
Canada: https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/ca.m3u

Add them the same way you added the main tuner (Dashboard → Live TV → 
Add Tuner → M3U Tuner → paste URL)


ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
The snap installation paths don't match Docker container paths:
- Snap config: /var/snap/itrue-jellyfin/common/data/
- Container path: /config/data/ (doesn't exist in snap)

Your Jellyfin is running as a SNAP on the Proxmox host, not in a 
Docker container, so those /config/ paths are invalid.
