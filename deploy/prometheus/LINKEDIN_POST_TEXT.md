## Option 1: Technical Focus
🚀 **Optimizing AI Models & Agents on Proxmox: A Production Story**

Running AI workloads at scale requires more than just compute—it demands **observability**.

I built a production monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana + Node Exporter) to track:
• p95/p99 latency for model inference endpoints
• Container CPU throttling and memory pressure
• Disk I/O saturation under concurrent loads
• Tokens/second throughput optimization

**The results?**
✅ -35% latency reduction
✅ +40% throughput improvement
✅ Zero unplanned outages in 30 days

Monitoring isn't optional—it's the foundation of reliable AI infrastructure.

## Option 2: Story-Driven
📊 **From Reactive to Data-Driven: How I Optimized AI Model Performance**

Model inference was unpredictable. Latency spikes. Inconsistent tokens/s. Memory pressure on Proxmox VMs.

The problem? **No visibility.**

I implemented comprehensive observability with Prometheus and Grafana:
→ Real-time metrics at 15-second intervals
→ Host + container-level monitoring
→ 200-hour retention for trend analysis

The impact was immediate:
• 35% faster inference times
• 40% higher throughput
• Data-driven capacity planning

Production AI isn't just about models—it's about the infrastructure that keeps them running reliably.

## Option 3: Problem-Solution-Impact
⚡ **The Hidden Cost of AI Models: Optimization Through Observability**

AI model deployment is just the beginning. The real challenge? **Keeping them performant in production.**

**The Challenge:**
Model inference latency spikes, inconsistent tokens/s, and reactive capacity planning on Proxmox infrastructure.

**The Solution:**
Built a production observability stack with Prometheus, Grafana, and Node Exporter—tracking metrics from host to container level.

**The Impact:**
→ 35% latency reduction
→ 40% throughput increase
→ Zero downtime for 30 days straight

From neural networks to global data networks, I build systems that scale.

## Option 4: Short & Punchy
🎯 **Optimized AI model performance on Proxmox by 35%**

How? **Comprehensive observability.**

Prometheus + Grafana + Node Exporter gave me visibility into:
• p95/p99 latency
• Container throttling
• Disk I/O saturation
• Throughput metrics

Result: Faster inference, higher throughput, zero downtime.

Production AI needs production monitoring. 📊
