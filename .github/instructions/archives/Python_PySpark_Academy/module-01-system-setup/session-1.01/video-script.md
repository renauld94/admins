# Video Script: Session 1.1 - Welcome & Introduction

## Duration: 7 minutes
## Instructor: Simon Renauld

### Opening (1 minute)
Welcome to the Johnson & Johnson Python Academy. I'm Simon Renauld, and I'll be your instructor throughout this comprehensive clinical programming training program.

This academy represents a significant investment in your professional development, designed specifically for clinical programming staff at Johnson & Johnson and our vendor partners worldwide.

### Program Overview (2 minutes)
Over the next six modules, we'll transform you from a traditional programmer into a skilled Python and PySpark developer capable of handling enterprise-scale clinical data.

Our program covers:
- Professional development environment setup
- Python fundamentals focused on healthcare applications
- PySpark for distributed clinical data processing
- Version control with Git and Bitbucket
- Databricks platform mastery
- Advanced clinical data pipeline development

What makes this program unique is our focus on real-world clinical programming challenges. Every example, every exercise, every project relates directly to the work you'll do processing clinical trial data, regulatory submissions, and healthcare analytics.

### Databricks Integration (1.5 minutes)
All practical work occurs in the Johnson & Johnson Databricks environment. This isn't just a learning platform – it's the same enterprise-grade system you'll use for production clinical programming work.

You'll find interactive notebooks for each session, sample clinical datasets, and progressive exercises that build real-world skills. The collaborative workspace enables team learning and knowledge sharing across our global clinical programming community.

### Program Structure (1.5 minutes)
We're using a modular approach that allows you to complete training at your own pace while new modules are still under development. Each module includes recorded short-duration sessions, allowing you to pause and practice with Databricks notebooks.

Small pilot cohorts will test each new module before general release, ensuring high-quality content that meets your actual work requirements.

Assessment quizzes at the end of each module ensure comprehension, while DU-SME led technical sessions provide ongoing support beyond the core curriculum.

### Success Outcomes (1 minute)
By program completion, you'll utilize PySpark for clinical data manipulation within Databricks, process large-scale clinical datasets efficiently, and implement professional data pipelines that meet J&J compliance requirements.

This isn't just training – it's your pathway to becoming a clinical programming professional equipped for the future of healthcare data processing.
