## Project Overview

### Learning Objectives
This comprehensive framework outlines the development of a Python-focused technical training program for Johnson & Johnson clinical programming staff and vendor partners.

### Target Audience
- **Primary:** 300+ Clinical Programming staff (J&J and vendors)
- **Secondary:** Technical leads and senior management
- **Scale:** Enterprise-level deployment with automated certification

### Content Scope
The program covers essential Python programming skills with specific focus on:
- **Core Python:** Fundamental programming concepts and data structures
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas for clinical data manipulation (reduced scope)
- **Big Data Processing:** PySpark for large-scale data operations
- **Cloud Platforms:** Databricks for collaborative analytics
- **Version Control:** Git/BitBucket for code management
- **AI Integration:** Assistant tools for productivity enhancement

### Delivery Strategy
- **Format:** Hybrid approach combining video content with interactive notebooks
- **Duration:** Modular design with 15-30 minute segments
- **Assessment:** Automated certification system to handle scale
- **Support:** SME access during development, limited long-term interactive sessions

### Implementation Framework
This specification serves as the foundation for creating a scalable, automated learning platform that can serve hundreds of technical professionals while maintaining quality and engagement through modern educational technology.
