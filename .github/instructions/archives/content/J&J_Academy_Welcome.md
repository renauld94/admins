# Johnson & Johnson Python Academy

## In-House Training Program

We are developing a simple in-house training program for basic Python, including Python fundamentals and PySpark on Databricks.

The goal is to support the upskilling of Clinical Programming staff at J&J and all vendors. The training academy and materials are designed so they can be added to the J&J LMS system and included in the role-specific training
