This is the legacy version of the Space theme adapted for Moodle 5.0. It provides basic compatibility with the latest Moodle release, preserving the look and feel of previous Space versions.

Note:
This legacy release is intended as a temporary solution for users upgrading to Moodle 5.0 who still rely on the older Space layout and features.

A brand new version — Space 3 — optimized specifically for Moodle 5.x, is currently in development and expected to be released in the coming weeks.

Stay tuned for the updated theme with improved performance, full Moodle 5 integration, and a refreshed design.
